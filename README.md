LEGO Agent OS

A reusable multi-agent development operating system for Claude Code

This repository contains a complete multi-agent framework designed to help you build world-class software, protocols, and products using Claude Code.

LEGO OS gives you:

Senior-level multi-agent teams

Template-driven product docs

Structured feature specifications

Standards-driven engineering workflows

Automatic context maintenance

Powerful multi-agent commands

Everything is orchestrated through Claude Code.

🚀 Quick Start
1. Open this folder in Claude Code

Claude automatically loads:

.claude/agents/

.claude/commands/

.claude/skills/

CLAUDE.base.md

all templates and standards

2. Initialize a project

Run:
/context-sync

This will:

generate mission, roadmap, tech-stack, changelog

create folder-level CLAUDE.md files

set up a clean project structure

ensure specs/templates align

3. Define your first feature
/spec-and-plan "booking flow v1"

This will generate:
docs/specs/booking-flow/
  feature-spec.md
  tasks-breakdown.md
  verification-checklist.md

4. Build it
/implement-feature

5. Review it
/code-review
/security-review
/smart-contract-review
/verify-implementation
