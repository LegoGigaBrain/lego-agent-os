# Brand Strategy Standards

> "Style guides don't make brands. Systems do."

## Purpose

This document governs all brand strategy work. Brand strategists decode frequencies, not create logos.

## Core Principles

### 1. Strategy Before Aesthetics
Never design visuals, write copy, or create content until the brand OS is installed. The signal must be clear before it can be transmitted.

### 2. Tension-Driven Positioning
Every brand must identify and resolve a cultural tension. Without tension, there is no necessity for the signal.

### 3. Myth Over Messaging
Build symbolic systems, not slogans. A brand's mythos should be deep enough to generate infinite content.

### 4. Onliness Statement
Every brand must be able to complete: "Our [offering] is the only [category] that [key differentiator]."

### 5. Archetype Alignment
Brands should identify their archetypal pattern (from Jung's 12 archetypes) to ensure consistent personality across all touchpoints.

## The Brand-as-Protocol™ Process

### SYNC Phase Checklist
- [ ] Founder/stakeholder interview completed
- [ ] Core resonance extracted ("Why are you really here?")
- [ ] Origin pulse identified (the vision that started it all)
- [ ] Cultural tension defined
- [ ] Mystery mining completed (symbols, archetypes, totems)

### PROGRAM Phase Checklist
- [ ] Tagline crystallized
- [ ] Tone matrix defined (3-5 tonal qualities)
- [ ] Lexicon created (10-20 branded terms)
- [ ] Transmission lines drafted (recurring phrases)
- [ ] Visual direction articulated

### EMIT Phase Checklist
- [ ] Content themes defined
- [ ] Meme types identified
- [ ] Publishing rhythm established
- [ ] Codex document compiled
- [ ] Handover completed

## Quality Standards

### A Strong Brand Strategy Must:
- [ ] Be defensible (competitors can't easily copy)
- [ ] Be authentic (rooted in founder truth)
- [ ] Be tension-driven (resolves a real cultural conflict)
- [ ] Be generative (can produce infinite content)
- [ ] Be installable (can be handed to any creative and applied)

### Red Flags to Avoid:
- Generic positioning ("we're innovative and customer-focused")
- No clear tension or enemy
- Trying to appeal to everyone
- Style-first thinking (colors before meaning)
- Copying competitor positioning

## Frameworks to Apply

### ZAG Framework (Marty Neumeier)
1. Who are you?
2. What do you do?
3. What's your vision?
4. What wave are you riding?
5. Who shares the category?
6. What makes you the "only"?
7. What should you add or subtract?
8. Who loves you?

### Brand Flip Model
- Traditional: Company → Product → Customer
- Flipped: Tribe → Brand → Company
- The tribe comes first; the brand serves them

### Competitive Advantage (Porter)
- Cost Leadership
- Differentiation
- Focus (Niche)

Every brand must choose its strategic position.

## Integration with Other Departments

Brand Strategy outputs feed directly into:
- **Marketing**: Campaign strategy derives from brand signal
- **Content & Social**: Content pillars emerge from brand pillars
- **Communication Design**: Copy systems built on language stack
- **Design**: Visual design executes visual direction brief
