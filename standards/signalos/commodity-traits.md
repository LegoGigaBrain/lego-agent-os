# Commodity Differentiation Standards

> "You don't need a better product. You need something bigger than the product."

## Core Philosophy

In a world of commoditization, product features alone cannot create differentiation. The brands that win are those that wrap their products in something bigger — a trait that transcends the functional and creates emotional resonance.

This standard defines the 8 Commodity Traits and their commandments for application.

---

## The 8 Commodity Traits

Any brand can adopt one or more of these traits to escape commodity competition:

| Trait | Principle |
|-------|-----------|
| **Story** | When the background story is bigger than the product |
| **Belief** | When values are bigger than the product |
| **Cause** | When purpose is bigger than the product |
| **Heritage** | When a sense of location is bigger than the product |
| **Delight** | When small surprises are bigger than the product |
| **Transparency** | When trust is bigger than the product |
| **Solidarity** | When belonging is bigger than the product |
| **Individuality** | When customization is bigger than the product |

**Note:** Ventures that understand branding at the root level rarely stick to one trait. The most powerful brands adopt many.

## Trait 1: Story

**Principle:** When the background story is bigger than the product

The founding story, the journey, the struggle — these create emotional connection that product specs never can.

### Story Commandments

1. **Go back to the roots**
   - Mine your founding story for narrative gold
   - The determination that fueled the launch often contains hidden stories
   - Origin stories create emotional anchors

2. **Make operational changes if needed**
   - If changing processes, staffing, sourcing, or location builds a bigger brand story
   - Short-term loss will be rewarded in the long term
   - The story must be true

3. **Make story the backbone of positioning**
   - Weave it into everything you say and do
   - Consistent repetition builds brand glue
   - Let the world form opinions based on repeated actions

4. **Tell, don't sell**
   - Supporting your story turns audiences into advocates
   - Shouting what you want them to buy turns them off
   - Story spreads; sales pitches don't

   - Focus groups are not enough — real engagement is required

2. **Voice beliefs honestly and boldly**
   - Passionate beliefs can become the driving force of business
   - Empathetic but bold expression attracts true believers
   - Fence-sitting attracts no one

   - If staff don't believe it, customers won't either

5. **Hold yourself accountable**
   - Issue progress reports yearly
   - Meet your own expectations
   - Transparency about cause progress spreads awareness
