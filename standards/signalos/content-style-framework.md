# Content Style Framework Standard

> "Style is not how you write. Style is why you write."

---

## Purpose

This standard defines how to create and use content style frameworks that go beyond generic approaches (like the "4 E's") to brand-specific systems.

---

## Why Custom Style Frameworks

Generic frameworks (Educate, Entertain, Engage, Empathize) are:
- **Non-differentiated** - Everyone uses them
- **Purpose-agnostic** - Don't reflect brand intent
- **Forgettable** - No brand personality

Custom frameworks should:
- **Reflect brand purpose** - Each style advances the mission
- **Use brand vocabulary** - Named in brand language
- **Guide production** - Clear when to use each style

---

## Framework Structure

A style framework has 4-6 styles, each with:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Name** | Brand-native term |
| **Purpose** | What this style achieves |
| **When to Use** | Specific scenarios |
| **Example Hook** | Sample opening line |
| **Color** (optional) | For Notion visual coding |

---

## Example: Untethered Framework

| Style | Purpose | When to Use | Example Hook |
|-------|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **Reveal** | Uncover truth, pull back curtain | Teaching, revelation sharing | "Here's what nobody tells you about..." |
| **Challenge** | Confront assumptions, flip scripts | Disrupting religious thinking | "What if everything you believed about X was..." |
| **Invite** | Create space, extend belonging | Community building, welcome | "If you've ever felt like..." |
| **Witness** | Share testimony, show process | Personal story, transformation | "Here's what happened when..." |
| **Sync** | Provide tools, practical guides | Actionable content | "Try this next time you..." |

## Creating Custom Frameworks

### Step 1: Identify Brand Intents
What are the 4-6 main things your content tries to do?
- Educate?
- Provoke?
- Comfort?
- Challenge?
- Invite?
- Demonstrate?

### Step 2: Name in Brand Language
Don't use generic terms. Use brand vocabulary.
- "Educate" → "Reveal" (if brand is about uncovering truth)
- "Entertain" → "Play" (if brand embraces playfulness)
- "Engage" → "Sync" (if brand uses network language)

### Step 3: Define When to Use
Each style needs clear triggers:
- This style for pain point content
- This style for community content
- This style for teaching content

### Step 4: Create Example Hooks
Template opening lines for each style help creators get started.

## Framework Integration

### With Content Matrix
Style becomes a **Select** property in Notion databases:
- Each piece of content is tagged with one style
- Calendar views show style variety
- Never post same style back-to-back

### With Content Strategy
Map styles to narrative arc stages:
- Entry content (Stage 1-2) might favor Challenge/Invite
- Depth content (Stage 3-4) might favor Reveal/Witness

### With Production
Creators check style before writing:
- "This is a Reveal piece, so I should open with..."
- "This is Challenge, so I should confront..."

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing a style framework:

- [ ] 4-6 styles (not too many, not too few)
- [ ] Named in brand language (not generic)
- [ ] Each style has clear purpose
- [ ] Each style has when-to-use guidance
- [ ] Each style has example hook
- [ ] Styles cover all content needs
- [ ] No overlap between styles

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **Too many styles** - More than 6 becomes confusing
- **Generic names** - Using "Educate" instead of brand terms
- **Overlapping purposes** - Two styles that do the same thing
- **No hooks** - Styles without example openers
- **Uneven use** - One style used 80% of time (rebalance)

---

## Reference: Common Generic Frameworks

### The 4 E's (Generic)
- Educate
- Entertain
- Engage
- Empathize

### The Hero's Journey Mapping
- Call to adventure
- Crossing threshold
- Trials and allies
- Return with elixir

### Content Pyramid
- Awareness content
- Consideration content
- Conversion content
- Retention content

**Note:** These can inform your custom framework but should not be used as-is. Translate into brand language.
