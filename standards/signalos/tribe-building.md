# Tribe Building Standards

> "The best customers are no longer consumers. They are tribe members who co-lead the company."

## Core Philosophy

In the flipped brand model, companies don't create brands — customers do. The company creates customers, customers create the brand, and the brand sustains the company.

This standard governs how to build, organize, and empower tribes rather than target market segments.

---

## The Brand Flip

### Old Model (Company-Centric)
```
Company → Creates Brand → Attracts Customers → Supports Company
```

### New Model (Customer-Centric)
```
Company → Creates Customers → Customers Create Brand → Brand Sustains Company
```

**The truth:** A brand is not owned by the company, but by the customers who draw meaning from it.

---

## From Segments to Tribes

### Why Segments Fail

Traditional segmentation divides customers into:
- Geographic chunks
- Demographic slices
- Psychographic profiles
- Behavioral categories

**The problem:** You can't segment a market that doesn't exist yet, or one where customers are moving targets, or one where every customer wants to be their own segment.

### Why Tribes Win

A tribe is any group of people who share not only interests, but information. They talk to each other. They identify with their tribe.

**Segmentation:** Divide and conquer
**Tribe building:** Multiply and conquer

## The I AM + POV Framework

The heart of tribe building is alignment between customer identity and company purpose.

### I AM (Customer Side)

| Element | Question | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Identity** | Who do they want to become? | "I want to be a creative professional" |
| **Aims** | What benefits do they seek? | "Tools that amplify my creativity" |
| **Mores** | How do they belong? | "We value craft over shortcuts" |

### POV (Company Side)

| Element | Question | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Purpose** | Why do we exist beyond money? | "To make tools for the mind" |
| **Onliness** | What makes us the only? | "The only computer company that designs the whole experience" |
| **Values** | How do we behave? | "We believe in thinking different" |

### The Alignment Rule

| Customer | Company | Alignment Check |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| Identity | Purpose | Do we help them become who they want to be? |
| Aims | Onliness | Does our unique offering serve their goals? |
| Mores | Values | Do our behaviors match their belonging rules? |

**If they don't align, you have a broken brand.**

## The 10 New Realities

These truths govern modern tribe building:

1. **Power has shifted** from companies to customers
2. **People seek meaning**, not just products
3. **Customers buy to build identities**, not just solve problems
4. **They hate being sold**, but they love to buy
5. **They buy in tribes** to feel safe and successful
6. **The battle is between tribes**, not companies
7. **The company with the strongest tribe wins**
8. **Tribes are connected through technology**
9. **Brands need to flow through multiple technologies**
10. **The most successful brands are not static, but fluid**

## Building Your Tribe

### Step 1: Define Customer Identity

Answer these questions about your ideal tribe member:

**Who are they?**
- Demographics (age, gender, location)
- Psychographics (values, attitudes, interests)
- Behaviors (how they spend time, what they consume)

**Who do they want to become?**
This is the most important question. It shifts focus from serving their current state to enabling their aspirational state.

| Brand | Customer Transformation |
|-------|------------------------|
| Google | Make people smarter |
| Apple | Make people more creative |
| Nike | Make people more athletic |
| Mini | Make people more conscientious drivers |

### Step 2: Create Customer Transformation Promise

**Framework:**
"We help [target customer] become [transformation] by providing [mechanism]."

**Examples:**
- "We help founders become legendary brands by providing belief-aligned brand systems."
- "We help creative professionals become industry leaders by providing AI-powered tools."

### Step 3: Design Belonging Mechanisms

How do people join and participate in your tribe?

**Belonging Layers:**

| Layer | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Awareness | They know you exist | Following on social |
| Interest | They engage with content | Reading, watching, listening |
| Consideration | They explore joining | Free trials, community lurking |
| Enrollment | They commit | Purchase, membership |
| Engagement | They participate | Using, contributing, creating |
| Advocacy | They recruit others | Referrals, content creation |
| Leadership | They co-lead | Community roles, collaboration |

### Step 4: Establish Tribal Mores

Every tribe has rules — social mores that define belonging.

**Define:**
- What behaviors are celebrated?
- What behaviors are rejected?
- What symbols signal membership?
- What language marks insiders?
- What rituals bind the tribe?

### Step 5: Build Mutual Loyalty

For brand loyalty to grow, it must be mutual. You must be loyal to your tribe.

**Six Benefits of Loyal Customers:**
1. They stop considering other brands
2. They request your brand by name
3. They recommend your brand to others
4. They wait longer and travel farther to get your brand
5. They accept brand extensions more readily
6. They continue to pay a premium price

**Your obligations:**
- Stand for something (even if unpopular)
- Protect your tribe's interests
- Deliver on promises consistently
- Give more than you take
- Evolve with your tribe

## The Brand Commitment Matrix

A simple tool for mapping the relationship between you and your tribe.

### Template

| Customer (I AM) | Company (POV) |
|-----------------|---------------|
| **Identity:** Who I am / want to become | **Purpose:** Why we exist |
| **Aims:** What I want from you | **Onliness:** What we uniquely offer |
| **Mores:** How I/we behave | **Values:** How we behave |

### Example: Apple

| Customer (I AM) | Company (POV) |
|-----------------|---------------|
| **Identity:** Creative professional who thinks different | **Purpose:** Make tools for the mind |
| **Aims:** Elegant, powerful tools that just work | **Onliness:** Only tech company designing hardware + software + services |
| **Mores:** We value design, simplicity, innovation | **Values:** Design excellence, user experience, bold innovation |

## Storyframing (Not Storytelling)

Traditional storytelling puts the brand as narrator. Storyframing puts the customer as hero.

### The Shift

| Storytelling | Storyframing |
|--------------|--------------|
| Brand tells stories | Brand provides framework for customer stories |
| One narrative | Many narratives within a structure |
| Passive consumption | Active participation |
| Brand is hero | Customer is hero |

### Storyframing Components

1. **The frame** — The boundaries that keep stories contained (Purpose, Onliness, Values)
2. **The protagonist** — Your customer (Identity, Aims, Mores)
3. **The touchpoints** — Where customer stories unfold
4. **The arc** — The transformation journey
5. **The profluence** — The feeling that the story is going somewhere

### Questions for Storyframing

- How will your customers tell their stories?
- Will they be able to create profluence in their own lives?
- What transformation does your product enable?
- How do you help them become the hero?

## Measuring Tribe Health

### The Brand Commitment Scale (BCS)

| Level | State | Measure |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Satisfaction | They're content (J.D. Powers surveys) |
| 2 | Delight | They're impressed (NPS, CX Index) |
| 3 | Engagement | They're enrolled (Participation metrics) |
| 4 | Empowerment | They're co-leading (Advocacy, UGC, community roles) |

**Goal:** Get as many customers as possible up the ladder to Level 4.

### Empowered Customer Indicators

- They incorporate your brand into their identity
- They depend on it for emotional support or social status
- They actively recruit others
- They contribute content and ideas
- They defend the brand publicly
- They move heaven and earth to ensure your success
