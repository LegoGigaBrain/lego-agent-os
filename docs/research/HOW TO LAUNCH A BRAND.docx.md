**HOW TO LAUNCH A BRAND**  
BOOK NOTES

**Introduction**

Brand is a service, product, company or person with

- A Soul: The brand platform  
- That is Attractive: The brand atmosphere   
- And Smart: Your brand’s identity

1. **Soul:**  
- Soul is the beating heart  
- It is the reason a company should exist  
- And also the reason that your initial attraction matures into love

You put your trust in brands with a soul:

- And often your money follows soon thereafter

Soul is the reason why we care for each other:

- Or a particular brand   
- Not much different than with human relationships

2. **Attractive:**  
- Attractive is the brand aura  
- The emotional connection you feel when you come into contact with the brand

It is the design & the voice that are carefully created

- And the curated over time,   
- In a consistent and particular manner

3. **Smart:**  
- Smart is its usability

How easy is it to engage with the product or service?

- For the tech industry, excellent user interface and user experience are essential 

For the consumer products:

- Quality packaging design   
- And superior products are vital

For the service products:

- The design of key offerings often determines  
- Whether a brand is smart

The process (Framework) will be challenging at time

- But always educational

The Brand Development Process

1. Brand Platform  
2. Naming  
3. Identity  
4. Brand Atmosphere  
5. UI / UX Design

5 Major Steps You Need:

- To get from vision to successful brand creation

1. **Creating the Brand Platform**

Brand Platform Definition:

- A brand platform is a layered and interconnected web  
- Held together by a core of company values  
- This will help you understand, the what, how, who  
- And the all-important WHY of your brand

Brand Platform:

- Think of your new brand as a building   
- The brand platform is the foundation upon which construction takes place

If the foundation is strong and well considered:

- Anything built on it has a higher chance of being equally sturdy

Too often, New Brands rush to create:

- A company name and visual identity  
- Before having a firm Brand Platform in place  
- Essentially putting a beautifully designed cart miles before the horse

Before your chosen design firm begins any work:

- You want to have a keen understanding of your new brand’s  
- Benefits, Marketplace, Target Audience, Personality

A Good Brand Platform addresses all of those areas:

- Benefits   
- Marketplace  
- Target Audience  
- Personality of the brand  
- Assessing every aspect of brand and association within your future brand 

The Platform contains both:

- The tangible (e.g the selling points of a product)  
- The Intangible (e.g the attitude of the brand)

Working systematically:

- A brand platform explores all these areas  
- Culmination in a holistic portrait of your brand-to-be

A Strong Foundation (Brand Platform) serves as a guide in developing

- The brand’s identity  
- Consumer relationships  
- And marketing

The company’s **voice** must be **clear**, **consistent** & **compelling**

It must have a distinctive personality:

- “Innovative, sexy, geek-chic and rebellious”

All of this will be the result of the identity design & product design:

- And advertising campaign built on a brilliantly engineered brand platform

Leadership Expert: Simon Sinek explains Apple’s Success:

- In his TED Talks entitled “How Great Leaders Inspire Action”  
- Sinek argues that Apple has the same access to technology, talent, agencies and media as its competition

What sets Apple apart is the foundation upon which the company is based

- Where most brands explain what they do and how their product differs

Remarkable brands go one step further:

- They tell the audience why their brand exists

In the case of Apple, it is as follows:

- “We believe in challenging the status quo  
- We believe in thinking differently   
- The way we challenge the status quo is by making our products beautifully designed and user friendly  
- We just happen to make great computers”

This level of communication:

- Connects with the audience on both an emotional and logical level  
- Thus relating to the consumer psyche

Business Plan vs. Brand Platform

- It is important to make the distinction between a business plan and a brand platform

Business Plan

- Although it does not have a specific format  
- It typically lays out the company’s   
- Goals and strategy  
- Over a set period of time and will include an assessment of projected earnings

Brand Platform

- Conversely, the key objective of a Brand platform   
- Is to clearly define a company’s target audience  
- And formulate a persona that will speak directly to that audience

This model assumes you already have a business plan in place

- But don’t worry if you don’t   
- A brand platform can significantly change or influence the business plan

**How to launch a brand** 

POSITIONING 

Questions:

* What makes your brand unique?   
* Why will consumers be drawn to your product?   
* How does the audience perceive your brand? 

These critical question play into your brand’s place in the market 

* it’s positioning 

Concretely defining your brand’s position is crucial:

* because it serves as a backbone for developing a business direction   
* Marketing message and overall identity 

The idea behind the brand is the concept (the word) 

* note that positioning is not the same as concept 

Positioning articulates the benefits (function) to the consumer

You may have the most brilliant idea for a brand 

* but if you cannot compel the consumer to make a purchase   
* You have nothing 

The positioning of a brand serves to define two points 

* what the product does   
* How the product is viewed by the target audience, in the competitive landscape in the short & long term 

Simplistic as it may sound:

* It can help to think of your brand in terms of problem & solution 

What daily struggle does your brand alleviate? 

Does your product/service help consumers save time or money? 

Will it make them feel fulfilled? 

* Give them an esteem boost?   
* Or provide a noteworthy experience 

Put yourself in your audience’s shoe:

* Why should they buy into your brand? 

All positioning falls into one or more of these categories:

* Functional (solves a problem or provides a tangible benefit)   
* Symbolic (provides a feel of belonging or self image benefit)   
* Experiential (provides physical or mental stimulation)

The Positioning statement, as explained by Geoffrey Moore

* Provides a clear, nuts and bolts description   
* Of your brand and should take the following form 

To (target audience)  
Our product is the (category)   
That provides (functional, symbolic or experiential benefits)   
Because (support/reason to believe)

* It is astonishing that a majority of statements leave out the most essential element   
* The reason to believe 

It takes entrepreneurs between one to four hours to get this sentence right 

* we aim for 2 hours 

But question your brand’s reason for being:

* And how you can persuade others to believe in your venture   
* It is well worth a few hours of pondering 

Samantha Paxson, CMO of Co-Op Financial Services 

* says “crafting this statement create an enormous amount of clarity, regardless of you are a startup or an ever-evolving Fortune 500”  
* “It serves as the foundation to a company’s or products true north”

Consider this example of a hypothetical: positioning statement 

* inspired by whole foods public mission statement   
* That could support the Whole Food brand   
* To (health & eco-conscious consumers)   
* Our (grocery stores)   
* Sell the (highest-qualify natural & organic products that support vitality and well-being)   
* Because (we believe in Whole Foods, Whole People and a whole planet)

As you can see, the “because” part:

* Is what really differentiates most brands on an emotional level   
* While informing the company’s brand as a whole 

Brand identity Association 

* Big Mac   
* Magical family friendly entertainment   
* Steve Jobs   
* The swoosh logo   
* Each phrase immediately conjures up images of the brand it represents   
* Macdonalds, Disney, Apple and Nike respectively and rather obviously 

Brand identity is a set of associations the target audience makes 

* with a product   
* That reinforces and deepens the positioning   
* To strengthen the relationship with the product 

Consumers’ relationships with brands are multifaceted:

* their interpretation of a brand include   
* Many touch points that require consideration 

There are four sources of brand identity Associations:

* Brand as product   
* Brand as organization   
* Brand as person   
* Brand as symbol 

Brand As Product: 

* Product lines   
* Specific products   
* Their attributes   
* Quality and value   
* Functionality   
* Aesthetics   
* User personality 

Brand as organization 

* The philosophy of your company   
* The brand’s attitude   
* Scope (I.e, local vs global) 

Brand as person

* Your brand’s character traits   
* And how users view their relationship with your brand   
* This may be typified by a company leader or spokesperson 

Brand as symbol 

* Physical properties of your product   
* A unique design   
* Identity (logo)   
* Advertising campaign   
* Or brand heritage (particularly if you are launching a brand under a pre-existing company umbrella)

At this stage of your brand’s development 

* You will find that some areas need to be fleshed out   
* Such as brand as symbol   
* As your brand begins to attain a visual identity   
* These areas will grow strength 

Using Apple Inc as a test case: 

* You can see the many areas of possible associations within a brand 

Brand as product (Apple) 

* iPhone   
* Apple Watch   
* Mac   
* Very intuitive   
* Sexy yet geared towards usability   
* Creative users 

Brand as organization (Apple) 

* Design driven   
* Creative cutting edge   
* Think different   
* Innovative 

Brand as person (Apple) 

* Steve Jobs   
* Responsible for making geeks hip abs hipsters geeky 

Brand as symbol (Apply) 

* Apple logo mark 

POINTS OF DIFFERENCE & BRAND VALUE

Today’s consumers have more choices than ever before 

When they are looking at home entertainment 

* they can pitch from hundreds of television channels online streaming services 

When they are shopping at the mall

* They have access to hundreds of stores and brands 

There are even thousands of toothpaste options on the market 

With so much competition

* Brands need a way to stand out   
* And capture their audiences attention 

All a brand needs is one strong point of difference:

* to distinguish it from the competition 

Subway: 

* Subway’s sandwiches have less fat than the products of most of the fast food providers

TOMS

* Toms donates a pair of shows to someone in need for each pair sold 

Thanks to a growing number of digital channels

* that allows consumers to interact with brands   
* Consumers have the opportunity to be well informed before they make a purchase 

SUCCEED WITH A PURPOSE

The most recent Edelman Good Purpose Study 

* which “explores consumer attitudes around social purpose; including their commitment to specific issues and their expectations of brands and corporations”  
* Supports the notion that consumers care about how brands address social issues 

Furthermore, the study suggests that social purpose 

* Plays a role in consumers’ purchasing decisions 

87% of Global consumers 

* Believe that Businesses need to focus on society’s  interests   
* At least as much as they do in the businesses’ own interest   
* Source: 20-2 Edelman Good Purpose Study 

80% of global consumers 

* Think it is important for companies to make the public aware of their efforts to address societal issues   
* Source: 2012 Edelman Good Purpose Study

71% of global consumer 

* would help a brand promote its products or services if there was a good cause behind them   
* Source: 2012 Edelman Good Purpose Study 

91% of global consumers 

* Would switch brands if a different brand of similar price and quality supported a good cause   
* Source: 2013 Cone Communication / Echo Global CSR Study 

Smart Brands 

* have a unique quality that sets them apart 

Bridget Field (Small Business,BC

* Calls this the “so-what factor”

If you’re opening a coffee shop, ask yourself? 

* “So what?”  
* “Isn’t there a coffee shop on every corner?”  
* What makes my coffee shop different? 

Once the difference is clearly communicated to consumers:

* The brand has a better chance of being selected over the competition. 

Experts suggest selecting a specific and real benefit over empty “puffy” claims; 

A Good Selling Proposition:

* “ A 10 year bumper-to-bumper warrantee”

A Poor Selling Proposition: 

* “Quality customer service”

The first claim makes a specific promise 

* Whereas the latter feels wishy washy   
* And is easily duplicates by any competitor

To ensure you differentiate your company from your competitors: 

* Make a list of the features and attributes of your services/product  
* Features: refer to specific functionality (e.g slip-proof grip)   
* Attributes: refer to non-tangible benefits (e.g “inexpensive”) 

From there, compare the features abs attributes of your brand 

* with those of your competitors in a Venn Diagram   
* Noting where you overlap   
* Where your competitors have unique qualities   
* And where you differentiate 

Consumers are triggered by emotion 

* far more than logic   
* See page 22-23 for case studies 

Smart brand 

* Make an emotional promise   
* To their audience by touring their product’s features and benefits 

These emotional benefits may include safety: 

* Affection   
* Status   
* Self-fulfilment   
* Knowledge   
* Independent and stability 

The Importance of connecting with your audience 

* You obviously need the consumer to buy in your brand 

To reach a specific audience 

* You need to understand them   
* And know how to communicate so they listen 

Knowing your audience 

* is a crucial aspect of your brand’s success 

Should anyone ask, “Who is your target audience?” 

* The answer is never “everyone”   
* Too often, entrepreneurs make the mistake of wanting to appeal to anyone and everyone 

Instead it is in your bedroom interest 

* to drill down into a specific market 

Start by using yourself 

* “Who really needs my products or services?”  
* Think about their problems, wants and needs

As marketing expert David Fry points out 

* “People don’t care about you until they know you care about them”

How does their problem make them feel?

* Anxious, unattractive or left out? 

Mr Fry Advocates

* “Rubbing salt into the wound”  
* That is, making them keenly aware of their problem   
* And your proposed solution

Show them how your brand has benefited others 

* and how it Best the competition

Identify your ideal customer 

* In his memoir abs manual on writing   
* Author Stephen King advocates writing   
* For an “Ideal Reader”  
* King’s is his wife, Tabitha

By focusing on one individual, King can:

* Ignore the compelling need to please every reader in the world   
* And instead deliver a solid and focused story 

Communicating your brand to an audience takes a similar approach 

* As stated earlier   
* Your brand will never appeal to everyone   
* But it can appeal to a specific market and enjoy enormous success 

Envision your ideal consumer 

* The person most apt to be interested in purchasing your product 

Consider how they are represented in the following demographic: 

* Categories   
* Gender, Age, Location, Ethnicity   
* Income, Education level, Mobility  
* Home ownership, Marital status, number of children 

Consider also psychographics variable 

* by drilling deeper into their personality  
* By considering things such as:  
* Values, Attitudes, Activities, Opinions   
* And anything else you can think of that will narrow your focus   
* See page 24

You can further flesh out your understanding Of your ideal consumer 

* by imagining a day un their life   
* What brands they prefer   
* Whether or not they impulse shop   
* Whether they’re bargain hunters or social shoppers   
* And whether they have any specific interest or family concerns 

Creating image boards 

* collages   
* Or mood boards   
* Or your different target audience personas   
* Can help you better visualise and connect with them 

All products and brands appeal to a niche market 

* Sometimes the product casts a wide net and captures a “mainstream niche”  
* At other times, the audience is more specialised 

The more specifically you understand your niche 

* The more effective you can reach that audience   
* And communicate the values of your brand   
* Cementing the relationship between your ideal customer and your brand 

Understanding the needs of your audience 

* The key to connecting with your audience is understanding what motivate them 

Review the following list of Maslow’s Hierarchy of Need 

* and brand requirements   
* Assessing where your offering fits into the system   
* Physiological Needs   
* Safety Needs   
* Belongingness needs   
* Esteem needs   
* Self-Actualisation   
*  See page 25-26 for kore 

Maslow’s Needs Hierarchy is a powerful tool to use 

* In determining the efficacy of your brand in terms of;   
* Audience   
* Business management   
* Product development   
* Visual identity   
* Message   
* And marketing language 

A clear knowledge of the needs and desires

* of your target customer   
* Allows your brand to connect in a more meaningful and compelling way   
* And stand out in a saturated market place 

UNDERSTANDING (& BESTING) THE COMPETITION 

Forewarned is forearmed

* Understanding your competition when launching a new brand 

Craig Fleisher & Babette Bensoussan state: 

* In their 2011 book Business & Competitive Analysis   
* Effective Application of New & Classical Methods   
* “Most firms operate on informal impressions, conjectures and intuition gained from tidbits of information”

Many new companies fail to thoroughly analyse their competition 

* whether out of laziness, self delusion or oversight 

To give your brand the best shot at success

* It is crucial that you honestly assess the competitive landscape 

Every brand has competition 

* No matter how unique your concept is   
* There will always be something else that is similar 

Competition

* A competitor selling the same product as you (e.g soup, coffee) is your direct competition

* A competitor selling a different product but targeting same audience is your indirect competition (e.g a bicycle shop, taxi service and car dealership.) (all who sell forms of transportation even they are very different forms) 

The best offence is a good defence

* This also applies to knowledge from your competitors 

By remaking one step ahead:

* Your brand can exploit the weakness of your competition   
* Anticipate their strategies   
* Predict shifts in the market place   
* And thwart threats from existing and new rivals 

Creating a detailed profile of a select few of your rival companies

* And even one of your brand   
* Can help you see how you measure up abs where there is work to be done

Background: 

* Location of headquarters   
* Offices, retail space and online presence   
* History of brand   
* Events in brand’s timeline   
* And trends within the company   
* Business structure   
* Ownership   
* B2B relationships 

Product / Services 

* In-depth examination of product lines   
* New product launches and success rates   
* Brand awareness and brand loyalty 

Branding 

* Name   
* Identity design   
* Tagline and key messaging   
* Brand colors   
* UI / UX

Marketing

* Customer base and loyalty   
* Promotional strategies   
* Social media presence   
* Distribution channels   
* Exclusivity agreements   
* Geographic areas   
* Pricing and discounts 

Personnel

* Number of employees   
* Key staff   
* Abilities   
* Management strength and style   
* Employee compensation   
* Morale  
* And retention rates 

Later of Protection 

* Even if branding is mainly about: positioning, image and voice   
* It provides something of much greater value for new ventures:   
* A thicker layer of protection 

With a start up product or service: 

* You may be so intrigued by its novelty or function   
* That you decide to make a purchase, if the price is right 

With a brand you fall inlove 

* Love is a strong word   
* Love does not fade easily 

Once you have created love 

* You will compete in a much higher level   
* One that is not about price 

Invest both time and money into the process of: 

* Translating your start up into a brand at time of launch 

Branding for new ventures

* Is first and foremost about an emotional connection   
* A strong immediate bond between product / service and person (customer)   
* If you make that happen, you can sit back   
* And let competitors come your way; you are protected 

Some of this information may be difficult to acquire 

* and some may not apply to your particular brand   
* But the exercise is well worth exploring to begin understanding the strength and weaknesses of the competition 

Even after your brand launches 

* It is imperative to monitor your competition   
* To note any changes in their messaging and strategy 

Additionally, new competitors will come to the market place 

* And will also require your attention and analysis 

Competitors may come from:

* Companies in related industries   
* Companies in other geographical regions   
* And start ups founded by employees from existing companies 

The market is primed for additional competition

* when demand exceeds supply   
* Profit margins rise   
* Growth potential is high  
* There is little completion or it is easy to start a brave in a particular field 

CONSTRUCTING A PHILOSOPHY 

why do certain brands connect better than others? 

* Great brand communicate on a deeper level 

In start with why: How Great leaders inspire everyone to take action

* Simon Sinek advocates that business should tell the consumer not what it does   
* But why it does it 

Giving your brand a voice and ideology 

* Creates a stronger bond with the audience 

Peer Insights’ Tim Ogilvie advises:  
—  That to attract the best employees and customers 

* Business should promote themselves as “a cause \- not just a company” (Berger, 2013\)

Brand expert Martin Lindstorm 

* Compare’a a brand’s story to religion doctrine   
* In his book Brand Sense: “sensory Secrets behind the stuff we buy”

Like the Bible, Torah or Koran

* A brand’s story is ingrained in the hearts and minds of true believers 

Touching on the hallmarks of organized religion 

* “A sense of belonging   
* Enemies   
* Storytelling   
* Rituals   
* A clear vision   
* Grandeur  
* Sensory appeal   
* Symbols   
* And mystery (2005, 127\) 

To illustrate his point: 

* Lindstrom points to brands with a cult following   
* Disney, Harley-Davidson, Apple, Hello. kitty  
* These brands signify note than a product to a fan   
* They are a way of life   
* With a resonate philosophy 

Human Nature Compels us to love a good story

* And make us hardwired to seek something to believe in And identity with   
* Whether that is religion, politics or cartoon Japanese cats with bows on their ears   
* Each of these brands sells an ethos 

Beyond the remarkable benefit: A strong philosophy has for your intended 

* it also boost morale among stakeholders and employees   
* It engenders loyalty and commitment 

Thoughtful Questions to arrive at a kore meaningful set of values: 

* Why does this brand exist?  
* Is there a compelling story behind the brand?   
* How could your brand experiment and grow moving forward   
* What does the world need that your brand is uniquely able to provide? 

Consumers now want more out of their brand than just products 

* See page 32 for Patagonia Example 

DEVELOPING YOUR BRAND’S PERSONALITY 

Consumers respond to brands that have a coherent and straight forward message 

Equally important to your message 

* Is selecting a distinctive voice and persona for your company 

The audience  demands Authenticity

* abs your brand’a voice must be authentic and transparent  

You can achieve this in a number of ways 

* Using relatable characters (Apple “I’m a Mac guy”)  
* A user’s perspective (Ford’s “Drive One” campaign) 

Characters give the audience someone to root for and follow 

* Think of the success of Dos Equis   
* “Most interesting man in the world” 

I’m digital and social media 

* A brand character can gain devoted following   
* Solidifying the bond between brand and buyer 

Your brand character 

* Jotting down a list of adjective that pertain to the character of your brag   
* Can be quite helpful in envisioning your brand as a person   
* See page 33 for a list of adjective 

Peter Walshe at marketing research consulting 

* Millward Brown   
* Contends that all good brands have a personality archetype   
* Based on jungian archetype theory   
* See page 35 for archetype list 

Thinking of your brand as a person will help you 

* Create an authentic voice   
* That will connect with consumers 

Imagining that your product is a person

* and writing an obituary that lists its accomplishments   
* And legacy can be helpful in creating that persona

DERIVING AND EMBODYING YOUR BRAND’S CORE VALUES 

Deriving your ventures core values early on is essential

* to formulating a strong brand from within 

Set out your value statements 

* I’m three very short   
* And actionable sentences 

Some Examples: 

* Challenge the status quo   
* Initiate Innovation   
* Proactively Collaborate   
* Actively Do Good   
* Be the example   
* Take some risks   
* Strive to make everybody win   
* Never stop achieving greatness   
* Personify our customers

Core values should not stay in a PDF document 

* Rather than being embodied by the team 

The more you practice 

* The more you embody the content and overall spirit   
* You must live the content 

Core values strategy: see page 37

* Trying assigning one of your new brand’s three core values to each day of the week   
* Then make it your goal to do something each day that turns the words of that core value into action

ESTABLISHING YOUR BRAND ARCHITECTURE

You have to launch a brand with a strategic growth plan in place 

You will not be able to forge ahead 

* On a deliberate path   
* Without something to guide you 

Having a strategic plan for: 

* For a brand architecture structure   
* Can help successfully guide the growth of your company   
* As it expands into a web of brands

* In early stages of your brand development   
* Will help you avoid the following mistakes   
* Narrowing branding focus   
* MisBranding
