**The Brand Flip Framework Notes**

Good Quote:

- Those who initiate change will have a better opportunity to manage the change that is inevitable – William Polland

A business has only one valid purpose: to create a customer

- Peter Drucker, 1973 book “The Practice of Management”

If the purpose of a business is to create a customer:

- Then it only has two basic functions: innovation and marketing

Innovation: Produces the product  
Marketing: Tells the stories that sell them

- These two activities drive results and all others are cost

10 Years Ago: the central problem of branding:

- Was how to align business strategy with customer experience

Today:

- It is how to empower the customer who will drive your success

Amazon CFO Tom Szkatak:

- “We believe putting customers first is the only way to create lasting value for shareholders”  
- Amazon is one of the growing number of companies that have adapted to and encourage – the primacy of customers

To the degree that the customer is the boss

- Shouldn’t we know what the boss wants?  
- ME: To the degree that that YHVH is the boss, shouldn’t we know what the boss wants?

**The best customers are no longer consumers, market segments or tiny blips**

They are individuals with:

- Hopes  
- And dreams  
- Needs and emotions

They exercise:

- Judgment   
- Indulge in whims  
- Express personal views  
- And write their own life stories  
- They are proactive, skeptical and creative

They’ve reached the top of Maslow’s pyramid of needs:

- Where goals are autonomy   
- Growth  
- Fulfilment  
- And they don’t consume

An explosion of connectivity and the power it gives customers:

- Is turning companies’ upside down

**The Question isn’t whether your industry will be disrupted but when\!\!**

The Old Model vs. The New Model of brand building:

The Old Model:

- Was based on the logic of factory management  
- The company created the brand (through products and advertising)  
- The brand attracted customers (as a captive audience)  
- And the customer supported the company (through repeated purchase)

The New Model:

- Is similar but with one important difference: the order of events

Instead of creating the brand first:

- The company creates customers (through social media and products)  
- Then the customers create the brand (through purchase and advocacy)  
- And the brand sustains the company (through customer loyalty)

This model takes into account a profound and counter-intuitive truth:

- A brand is not owned by the company, but the customers who draw meaning from it

Your brand isn’t what you say it is – it’s what they say it is

Customers no longer buy brands – they join brands

They require a measure of control over the products they love

- They want a vote in what gets produced  
- And how it gets produced

They are willing to roll up their sleeves and help out

- Not only by promoting the brand to their friends  
- But by contributing content  
- Volunteering ideas  
- And even selling products or services

Many of them know more about the company:

- Its products  
- Its pricing  
- Its competitors  
- Than the CEO or emplyees do

**The best customers are co-leading the company**

**10 New Realities**

1. Power has shifted from companies to customers  
2. People are not focused on products, but meaning  
3. Customers buy products to build their identities  
4. They hate being sold, but they love to buy  
5. They buy in tribes to feel safe and successful  
6. The battle is no longer between companies, but tribes  
7. The company with the strongest tribe wins  
8. Tribes are connected through technology  
9. Brands need to flow through multiple technologies  
10. The most successful brands are not static, but fluid

**From Products To Meaning**

Observe how marketing has changed:

- It moved from what the product has (Features) (Tangible goods for functional features)  
- To what it does (Benefits) (Functional benefits those features delivered)  
- To how it makes people feel (Experience) (Customer Experience, the experience of using our products)

It started out with:

- An object created in a factory  
- And ended up with an emotion created in a customer  
- It went from it being totally in the company’s control to partially outside of it

Today’s customers want more than:

- More than products  
- More than features  
- More than benefits  
- Even more than experience

They want meaning:

- They want a sense of belonging  
- They want creative control over their life stories

And they are likely to assemble those stories:

- From all the elements they find around them  
- Including products, services and brands

**They say; “If I buy this product, what does that make of me?”**

We are at the dawn of the “**meaning economy**”

Let us see this definition of a brand

- A gut feeling a customer has about a product or service or company

Why?

- It puts the customer at the center of the picture  
- It focuses everyone in the company on customer perception  
- Those fleeting experiences and fickle emotions that determine meaning  
- And offers a simple way to measure progress

If we listen to what customers say:

- And watch what they do  
- We can find out where we stand with them

**From Tangible to Immaterial**

How people & technology are favoring non-material over tangible goods\!

Technology has flipped our mindset from:

- “I need stuff”  
- To “I want an experience”

A recent study of S\&P 500 showed:

- That the monetary value of intangible assets had increased from 17%  
- To 80% over a 30-year period  
- The largest of these company assets were brands

What has driven the increase is:

- An ability to connect emotionally with customers

Through qualities such as:

- Immediacy   
- Personalization  
- Self-identity  
- And Empowerment

For now, there are still goods we need produced for us

- Like food, shelter, clothing and machines

The Goods themselves may be commodities:

- But the intangible benefits that are wrapped around them  
- Will makes them unique and empowering

A recent study shows that:

- Three- quarters of customers think that companies should work to improve the quality of their lives

Only one quarter believe that companies are actually doing that

- There’s plenty of room at the top

A successful brand can become a touchstone in a customer’s life

- A vivid symbol of what’s useful, delightful and even magical

**When a product becomes a symbol – the symbol becomes a product**

It can offer tremendous value as a building block in a customer’s personal identity

**From Selling to Enrolling**

Branding assumes that customers are more valuable over time than as a once \-off transaction

- It considers that they will pay more for a unique product than a generic one  
- And it understands that customers have aspirations beyond setting a low price on a particular product or service

Companies may sell products:

- But customers join brands

They sign up with companies that see them as people:

- And avoid companies that see them as targets

Branding creates a flywheel effect that can: drive success for decades

- It creates a company’s most powerful strategic advantage   
- Which is customer loyalty

Brand allows you to build business on customer retention

- Rather than customer acquisition  
- Any effort to get customers is marketing  
- Any effort to get customers and keep them is branding

For companies with, branding is the more strategic path

**From Company Identity to Customer Identity**

In the mid-20th century

- A service business grew up around identity design

At the time – A brand was literally a brand

- A typographical hot poker used to burn an identifying mark onto the company’s products  
- Abd with enough repetition: into customer’s minds

The focus was on who we are:

- Making sure that we looked modern, organized and professional

The prize went to the identities that pleased the most eyes:

- The best brandmarks were beautiful and still are

Business in those days was so company-centric

- That customers were treated as cattle  
- Commercial herds to be fenced, fed and harvested for corporate sustenance

Consider the phrases we still use to describe marketing:

- We segment audiences  
- Target customers  
- Round up leads  
- And capture market share

A business with herd-like customers is called a cash cow

- And people are called customers  
- As if their only job is to graze on the prairie  
- Until they can be segmented, targeted and converted

In the new customer-centric market-place

- “Who we are”  
- Is much less important than  
- “Who they are”

Customer Identity, not company identity:

- Is the secret to building a flipped brand

Its not enough to find out who your customers are

- You need to help them become the people they want to be

Their identity is shaped with every choice they make

- With every product they buy

**Now we come to the essence of the flip:**

If the goal is to create customers

- As Peter Drucker suggested  
- Shouldn’t we also be designing them?

Shouldn’t we be designing a framework in which our customers can see themselves?

- And build their unique identities  
- And ultimately become who they are?

Creating anything without design is usually a mess

- The last thing anyone wants is a messy business

Brand helps you to have an ownable business idea

- That people can’t copy or steal

Develop a highly focused brand:

- Who loves your products or services?  
- Which men or women?  
- Where are they?  
- What are their goals  
- More important, who do they want to become??

Google found Larry Pages had a simple goal:

- To make people a little smarter

Steve Jobs’ goal at Apple:

- To make them a little more creative

Mini USA:

- Wants its customers to be conscientious drivers

Joie De Vivre founder of Chip Conley:  
Wanted his hotel guests to “refresh their identities”

What should you want for your customers?

How might you help men/women build their identities?

**Better Products to Better Customers**

In a flipped brand/business

- The product is not the innovation  
- The customer is 

The battle is no longer between companies 

- But between the people who buy from them

**In other words:** the nature of your customers determines the future of your company

- The company with the best customers wins

The lesson is this:

- Instead of thinking about how to improve and position your products  
- Think about how to improve and position your customers  
- They are the ones who will fight for your success

In his book “Who do you want your customers to become?” Michael Sohrage says:

- “Truly successful innovations generate wealth for their users, not just their creators”

Wealth is not only financial:

- It can be; social, educational, physical, spiritual and temporal  
- Any good that people get out of a product or service

QUESTION FOR FRAMEWORK:

- What is the highest good you can want for your customers?  
- And how will you back it up or enforce that good?

Ritz-Carlton (Case Study)

- Ritz wants its guest to be more sophisticated  
- Its motto: “We are ladies and gentlemen serving ladies and gentlemen”

When you treat yourself to the impeccable service at the Ritz:

- Your self-image sours to lofty new heights  
- And you somehow find yourself exuding greater confidence, generosity and charm

Dell (Case Study)

- Dell wants to “enable customers everywhere to grow, thrive and reach their full potential”  
- The company backs it up with its “nurture” program  
- Which also generates order amounts of 25% higher than the previous average

P\&G (Case Study)

- P\&G puts its customers’ ambitions right smack in its purpose statement  
- “We will provide branded products & services of superior quality and value that improve the lives of the world’s customers, now and for generations to come”

The Primary Good:

- That a company can offer its customers is empowerment  
- The best brand builders see greatness in their customers and figure out ways to enable it

By Contrast: Las Vegas

- Las vegas casinos care little about their customers’ lives beyond offering a brief respite from the daily tedium  
- When visitors get back home, they’ll face the same old grind but with thinner wallet  
- This is the opposite of seeing greatness in customers  
- Instead, they see only weakness, naivete and addictive behaviour

**NB: All profitable brands are habit-forming at some level**

- That makes them sustainable  
- The only question is whether the habit, on balance, is a healthy or unhealthy one

QUESTIONS:

- What else could your product or service be?  
- What does a (customer identity) want that the (product/service) could provide?  
- What are some of the jobs this product can do for them?

THE NEXT FLIP**: A Shift From Segments To Tribe**

**From Customer Segments to Customer Tribes**

Segmentation

- A handy strategy for targeting customers in an existing market

You identify a large market:

- Then cut it up into smaller slices according to categories such as:  
- Geography (regions, countries, cities)  
- Demographic (age, gender, occupation, education, income)  
- Psychographics (activities, interests, opinions)  
- Behavior (product usage, familiarity, loyalty)  
- Or Benefit Preference (one segment per preference)

Then you target each chunk with a different offering

- Divide and conquer

But how do you segment a market that doesn’t exist yet?

- Or a quickly changing market where customers are moving targets?

Or a market in which every customer wants to be his or her own segment?

- You have to flip your thinking (upside down kingdom \#BB)

Instead of division, you need multiplication:

- Start with a small market  
- And scale it up with social media  
- Multiply and conquer

Internet has brought an ability to:

- Form groups across boundaries  
- Whether geographic, demographic, psychographic or other graphic

Social Tools now allow REGF

- Ridiculously easy group-forming  
- A term coined by Sebastien Pacquet

REGF makes hash out of segmentation:

- Since people routinely ignore the boundaries marketers place on them  
- We just go where we want to go  
- Do what we want to do  
- And become who we want to become

We want to be unique:

-  But we want to be in unique groups

We want to stand out:

- But we want to stand out together

In the age of easy group forming:

- The basic unit of measurement is not the segment  
- But the tribe

A tribe is any group of people:

- Who share not only interests, but information  
- They talk to each other  
- They identify with their tribes

They identify with their tribe:

- I am a surfer  
- I am an Anglophile  
- I am a gamer  
- I am a cat person

They also identify with brands:

- I am an Audi person  
- I am  an Android person  
- I am a Mets fan  
- I am a thronie

Since tribes can form quickly and organically: you don’t target a tribe

- You support it  
- Grow it  
- Partner with it  
- Organize it

Research shows that customers who:

- Interact socially with other customers in a brand community  
- Often develop an intense sense of loyalty   
- Both to the brand and to each other

These are the people who are most likely to:

- Stand up  
- And fight for your success

The best question to ask any new product marketer

- Is not “what size is the market?”  
- But “You and what army?”

**What makes a brand strong is the mutual commitment between companies and their customers**

Leaders often spend too much time organizing their employees:

- And not enough time organizing their customers  
- The group with the real power

By empowering and growing the tribe

- You increase its strength against competing brands  
- Which in turn increases ability to support the tribe

HOW DO YOU BUILD A TRIBE?

- The trick isn’t finding the biggest possible market  
- Its seeking out the truest possible fans

“Too many organizations care about numbers, not fans:”

- Writes Seth Godin in his book tribes  
- “What they’re missing is the depth of commitment and interconnection that true fans deliver”

What fans respect and is generosity and bravery:

- A brave company is one that stands up for its customers

Difference not sameness – Innovation, not pandering the crowd

In a time when everyone is a potential media outlet:

- It is true fans who can drive the conversation

But first they’ll ask:

- “What does sharing this information say about me?”

Next, they’ll ask:

- “Do I believe in the values of this company?”

Every tribe has its social mores

- Its rules of behavior  
- A particular sense of what’s right and what’s wrong within a tribe  
- If you run afoul of these rules, you’ll be shunned

Tribes have insiders and outsiders

- You can’t expand a tribe  
- But you can’t break its rules

Don’t address a potential market that is far too big:

- With a modest product and limited budget

You need to start smaller

- Find your true fans  
- And help them grow the brand from there

I AM – The customer side of the equation

Customer Design:

- The anatomy of a (selected customer)

**From Transactions to Relationship**

A sale requires a single transaction:

- A brand requires thousands or even millions of transactions  
- Plus, a huge number of relationships

To manage these relationships:

- You need to master the complex machinery of brand building

KEEP IT SIMPLE

Start with a document that:

- Maps out the basic contract between you and your customer  
- Then build it out element by element – move by move

With each new element or more:

- Go back to the original contract  
- And make sure you haven’t violated its terms

If your brand efforts get off course (and it probably will)

- Go back to the basics

Use the BRAND COMMITMENT MATRIX:

- The simple tool at the heart of relationship

How it works: It has two columns:

- One for customers  
- One for the company

For the customers: The statements will describe

- Their identity (Who they are)  
- Their aims (What they want)  
- Their Tribe’s Mores (How they belong)  
- These form the I A M

For the Company: The statement will describe

- Purpose (Why we exist)  
- Onliness (What we offer)  
- Values (How we become  
- These form the P O V

The statements in each column should align horizontally:

- Customer identity & Company Purpose should align  
- Customer aims & Product/Service Onlyness should support each other  
- Tribal mores & company values should be in sync

If they don’t align:

- What you have is a broken brand  
- If they do: you have the basis for a rich and productive relationship

Identity:

- A customer vision (a vision your customer has for their life)  
- What do you want your customers to become?  
- Can your product/service accomplish such a goal?

Aims:

- These are benefits that the product offer

Mores:

- The rules of the tribes

A simple plan for partnership:

- This view of branding assumes the dawn of a post-consumer world  
- In which the brand is the joint property of the company and customer  
- The badge under which the customer builds her identity and creates their best self

**LEADING THE TRIBE**

**From Authority to Authenticity**

The rise of consumerism combined with the democratization of technology

- Encourages us to look deeper inside the companies we do business with

People began to glimpse at the motives, practices and deceptions that had previously been obscure

Today, we no longer accept the authority of large organization simply because they are large

We now look for something more than authority – we look for authenticity  
What is authenticity?

- Authenticity is in the eye of the beholder

To achieve authenticity with your tribe:

- You have to begin with purpose

A company’s purpose, simply stated:

- Is the reason it is in business beyond making money 

**Examples of companies’ purposes:**

Google’s Purpose:

- To organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful

Apple’s Purpose:

- To make tools for the mind

Cirque du Soleil’s Purpose:

- To invoke the imagination, provoke the senses and evoke the emotions

Coca-Cola’s Purpose

- To refresh the world  
- Simplest of all

Blaen Design’s Purpose:

- To terraform creation

Conversely, if your purpose is:

- To maximize shareholder value  
- You’re aiming in the wrong direction  
- While shareholder is a legitimate goal, it is not an authentic purpose

You should never change your purpose:

- It is the reason you exist – your true north

You can change:

- Your mission  
- Switch your market   
- Shift your strategy  
- Redesign your products  
- Revise your taglines

When you align your purpose with your customer’s identity

- You get something called fit

Fits let your customers know they have found the perfect fit

- The genuine article  
- The honest-to-goodness best company ever  
- Your purpose fits their identity

When a company is perceived as inauthentic 

- It uses an inauthentic medium   
- To deliver an inauthentic message  
- The only message people get is “We lie”

In Contrast: Many businesses skip advertising altogether

- And simply focus on being “remarkable”  
- As Seth Godin puts it in his book “Purple Cow”

Successful Giants:

- Tend to focus on customer experience  
- Than advertising

Chip Conley:

- The words used to describe her dream products  
- “the same words she would use to describe herself”

Decoding The New Customer Mind – Kit Yarrow

- Marketing psychologist professor  
- 4 Qualities of an authentic company  
- Page 58

Kit Yarrow says authenticity is potent:

- Because it is the “antidote to our online live”  
- We now inhabit a “photoshopped, intangible and virtual online world”  
- That causes us to crave what is real (real is the new currency)

**In branding what is real begins with purpose:**

Without attaching your product to a deeper meaning:

- It would end up just another alternative to \-------- insert competitor here

One reason purpose is so powerful

- Is that it can help a company over hurdles  
- That would seem insurmountable to less committed rivals

YET, even purpose, passion and commitment are not enough to win the race

- You need strategic differentiation

**From COMPETING to Differentiating**

Differentiation:

- Differentiating is the process of staking out a market position that you can own and defend

When your offering is unique & compelling enough:

- You don’t need on price  
- In fact, you don’t need at compete much at all  
- Except for attention

In most customers’ minds, there is only one:

- Amazon  
- Patagonia  
- Dyson  
- Twitter  
- Muji  
- Tesla  
- Resetta Stone  
- Mayo Clinic

These companies and their products stand alone because:

- Of their design  
- Their approach  
- Their beliefs  
- Their vision   
- Or some other special quality

One way or another:

- They are achieving a state of onliness

When you are the “only in your category:

- You can name the tune  
- The fast-following competitors must dance to

You can decide/define:

- You can decide/define criteria of purchase:  
- According to Niraj Dawar, author of tilt:  
- “You don’t need to sweat every product launch, every new feature introduced by a competitior”  
- He says: “Just pay attention to those who would wrest control of the criteria of purchase”

For example: 

- Volvo has famously differentiated on (safety)   
- allowing it to later take credit for airbags and pedestrians detection 

As long as Volvo stays focused on its Onliness

- direct competitors will have to play second fiddle 

   
Onliness allows you to: 

- start small by dominating a niche and growing it   
- Or growing with it over time 

Multiply and conquer: 

- increase your dominance by giving your to tribe   
- The easily understood difference it needs to attract more like-minded customers

With the right differentiator 

- you can win a kind of monopoly   
- A significant competitive advantage in your category  

The idea is to avoid competition

- or at least the direct kind that necessitates price cuts 

When competitors engage in price Wars: 

- they compete away their profits 

But how do you create Onliness? 

- and how do you know if you already have it?   
- Here’s a simple but headache-producing test  
- Our brand is the only (category) that (differentiator)

In the first blank put the name of your category: 

- (Robotics company, online university, fast food chain

In the second blank put your key differentiator:

- “Sells voice-mimicking parrots”  
- “Makes you the teacher”  
- “Caters to vegans”

When you compress your differentiator 

- into a tiny statement   
- It’s much easier to see what you have 

Watch out for “ands” or commas 

- they are vampires that can drain away your difference   
- See page 60

Don’t compete, Differentiate

**From Process to Values** 

In today’s age of customer control 

- company processes are still important   
- But they are subject to increasing flux

They need to be invented and reinvented on the fly 

- according to the desires and dictates of customers

They can’t be developed at the top of the organisation 

- And handed down for workers to implement   
- They must be designed by the worker themselves and often in the moment 

To accomplish this: 

- a company must develop a culture of creative autonomy   
- Guided by a share understanding of “how we work together” or “how we behave”

Company culture is the complement to customer MORES 

- the rules that determine how customers belong to tribes 

The best way \-\> To shape company is to: 

- encourage adherence to a set of values 

For example: the world class experience that Ritz-Chalfont provides 

- it provides its guest   
- Comes directly from its master value of “service”  
- This value is broken down into 12 sub-values that employees must agree to uphold. 

When a company culture goes bad 

- the brand suffers immediately   
- Eroding revenues   
- Tribal trust   
- Customer loyalty 

Culture provides nearly endless benefits:

- from boosting employee satisfaction   
- To fostering a cohesive brand   
- And a spirit of innovation   
- It attracts abs keeps better talent   
- Inspires more customers   
- And helps a company outlast its competitors 

Cultural values must sync up with customers Mores: 

- “How we behave” must align with “how they behave”  
- The values of her employees should map up closely to those of her customers 

Now that you’ve completed the matrix: what’s next? 

- it’s time to start building out the brand 

Using the matrix, you’ll imagine the experience 

- that will help your customers create their identities 

From Features to Experience 

The best brands are vivid:

- they conjure clear mental pictures   
- And powerful feelings in the minds and hearts of customers 

They come to life through their touch points 

- the points at which customer experience them

From the first exposure to a brand’s name 

- to buying the product   
- To using it   
- And eventually making it a part of who they are 

To design experience: 

- you have to use a combination of analysis and empathy   
- To better serve your customer 

Together Empathy abs Analysis 

- Can create a virtuous circle of improvement 

“Transcendental Customer Experience”

- emotional encounters that generate lasting shifts in beliefs and attitudes   
- And sometimes even self-transformation 

Think of Brand Experience as “Fractals” of the overall brand 

- Each experience is the brand in miniature   
- A representative sample of what your customer understands about the company and it’s offering 

If you find that a particular experience 

- doesn’t reflect your overall brand, pull it out   
- It’s a weed in an otherwise purposeful garden 

Every Experience \-\> Every touch point 

- Should illustrate the meaning of the brand   
- And offer another way for your customers to build the identities 

In practice: Which touch points works best? 

- and how many should you have?   
- 1\. The most telling touch points   
- 2\. As few as possible

The more touchpoints you create: 

- the more complexity and cost you introduce into the business 

At the same time: 

- you want to give customers as much access to your brand as possible   
- Anytime, anywhere 

Two step process for developing your touchpoints: 

- see page 71  
- Shallow/General Quadrant where brand awareness begins   
- Deep/General Quadrant which are more tribal (the initiation)   
- Shallow/Personal Quadrant social Media (Brand engagement after awareness  
- Deep/Personal Quadrant community/tribal engagement (world/movement) 

You might think customer experience us all work and no profit 

But you are wrong \- Research has shown that:

- experience is one of the richest areas to mine shareholder value 

From Punishment to Protection

What goes up must come down 

- for companies that punish their customers with bad experiences 

A recent study discovered an 80/50 rile: 

- 80% of business is service   
- And 80% of customers report bad service 

Company’s that punish their customers 

- Are fair game for flipped brands   
- Netflix, T-mobile, southwest l and others have taken advantage of the 80/50 rule   
- By breaking it 

Marketing Psychologist Kit Yarrow notes: 

- Customers want 5 things from a purchase decision   
1.  To feel more in control 

2\. To reduce the fear of making a mistake   
3\. To simplify the decision process   
4\. To offer clear abs immediate emotional benefits   
5\. And, to be free of obstacles 

Of these 5, she says: 

- Customers control is the “best antidote to anxiety”  
- Anxiety goes far to explain the extraordinary power of customer reviews 

Psychology Professor Ryan Martin says that: 

* although we tend to share the happens of people we are closest to   
* We are quite willing to join the “rage of strangers” 

Raye Claims, Immediate attention of on social media 

* A full 80% of purchasers say they have changed their minds, after reading a single negative review 

How can you avoid the wrath of customers who feel wronged? 

* by flipping your brand from customer punishment to customer protection 

Start by: 

* uncovering the hidden   
* Cost   
* Risks   
* Irritations   
* Anxieties   
* Abs points of confusion   
* In your customer interactions 

Questions: 

* What keeps them from buying?   
* Why do they exit your website mid-purchase?  
* What are their questions when they call customer service?  
* How can you reduce their anxiety?   
* How can you Eliminate boredom?   
* Make customers feel in control and give them control 

One tool you can apply is forgiveness

* forgiveness is a conceit that took root in user-interface design 

It includes features like “Undo”

* for when you change your mind 

Did you mean…

* for when you’ve made a mistake 

Are you sure…

* before you make an important decision

“Auto save”

* to keep you from starting over   
* And the ability to come back to your last screen after you exit 

A forgiving format is one: 

* That accepts various kinds of user input   
* And let’s the system sort it out 

Employ Forgiveness to create “subscriber happiness” 

What can you do to show kindness and empathy towards your customers?

Research: Polls for Y\&R’s Brand Asset Valuator indicate that:

* customers’ expectation for “kindness abs empathy”  
* Have increased 391% in recent years 

PART 3

**DESIGN THE WAY FORWARD** 

**From Deciding to Designing** 

You can’t decide a great customer experience 

* you have to design it 

Designing is the only way to create a vibrant set of touchpoints 

* That enables customers to fully engage with your brand 

We were taught to 

* Memorise  
* Analyze   
* Debate   
* And defend   
* These are valuable skills 

But to excel at creative tasks we also need to imagine: 

* Imagine   
* Intuit   
* Visualise  
* And prototyping  

The design mode is about flipping brands 

* from mere mimicry to strategic differentiation 

Design is difficult to explain \- but easy to demonstrate 

* It reveals itself more easily through artefacts than language 

Brand experience Map Design 

* the objective of the map is to make sure each of the four quadrants   
* Contains enough great touch-points   
* So that customers can find their way   
* From passing interest in the brand  
* To a rich engagement with it 

Of course not all customers will engage deeply 

* Nor can all brass offer the kind of depth that will create a lifelong commitment 

The best Quadrant for fostering commitment is 

* Deep personal one   
* Here is where you begin to hand control of the brand to customers 

You help them find special jobs 

* in the context of the tribe   
* Jobs that let them express personalities   
* Add social capital to their lives   
* Help them build their skills   
* Make a difference   
* Or even making money 

The success of design is not determined by how much you spend 

* but how well you spend it 

From Plan to Experiments 

There’s an old adage in business 

* if you fail to plan   
* You plan to fail   
* But business plans fail most of the time 

Why does this happen?

* because plans specifically those involving innovation  
* Are necessarily based on faulty assumptions 

There is no way to predict

* Whether or not the market will embrace a new:  
* Product   
* Service   
* Feature   
* Or business model 

There are too many unknowns 

To succeed in a dynamic market 

* You have to flip your approach from planning to experimenting 

In his book; The Innovator’s Hypothesis, Michael Schrage says:

* Plans are based on a presumption of knowledge   
* Whereas experiments are based on a presumption of ignorance 

It’s better to learn off-stage

* So you can triumph on stage 

“Innovation amateurs talk good ideas”

* he says “Innovation experts talk testable hypotheses”

A hypothesis, embodied as a prototype 

* beats market research because it can be tested 

Customers don’t have to imagine how they would feel when they see a prototype 

* they’re already feeling it 

The secret to great prototypes 

* is to design them quickly and cheaply 

Design is thinking with your hands 

Think of design as a rich conversation 

* that brings you closer to the truth of your brand 

The goal isn’t to impress your customers 

* but to let them impress you with reactions, knowledge and insights 

From Overchoice to Simplicity

Why do companies create clutter? 

* because simplicity has many enemies 

It takes great clarity, courage and discipline to vanquish them 

The most common enemy of simplicity 

* The human impulse to add

See page 103: Seven Enemies of Simplicity 

Constant addition without subtraction always makes a mess 

* a mess is counter-productive when you’re trying to create   
* A meaningful differentiation for your brand 

Delight in the minimal \- the ultra clear 

* the super simple  
* Never add without trying to subtract first 

From Static brands to Liquid brands 

We live in a time of “meta-change”

* A period in which the very nature of change   
* Is changing 

It speeds up to the point where: 

* Competitive advantage is measured in months instead of years 

And the direction of change has become much more turbulent 

* information flows not only from top to bottom   
* But from bottom to top, side to side   
* And a hundred other ways all at once 

It is no longer possible for a business to build a monolithic brand 

* on top of a built-to-last strategy 

Instead, it has to flip into a new model 

* One that can adapt to change   
* Enrol customers on their own terms   
* And relinquish more control of the brand to advocates 

Phase Change 

* A structural shift from company-focused business  
* To a customer-focused business   
* Think of a solid changing into a liquid   
* Or I e melting into water 

Now it has the ability to flow 

* An ability to find new ways forward  
* To adapt to changing circumstances   
* And to touch everyone and everything in its path 

A flipped brand can course forward across platforms 

* Through channels   
* Over boundaries   
* And into touch points   
* It can branch out to adjacent markets   
* And braid itself into longer revenue streams 

Brands can no longer afford to be static 

* They need to grow, spread abs flow into new areas 

This is known as branching 

* the art of sequencing markets 

Every brand is a running narrative  

* a story in process   
* Whose hero is the customer 

If at any point the story splits into two 

* And gets aimed at two different tribes  
* You then have two brands

To keep the narrative together 

* Each new feature, extension or product   
* Must keep something from the original direction   
* To preserve logical continuity 

From Storytelling to Storyframing 

As the nature of change, changes

* so does the nature of stories 

Meds theorist Douglas Rushoff wrote 

* A fascinating book called “Present Shock”  
* In which he claims we’re losing our capacity to absorb traditional narratives 

Once upon a time stories could hold audiences captive 

* Today 30 seconds of commercial narrative is too long

Viewers are not only bored with the one-way conversations 

* but also annoyed that someone they don’t trust would try steak their time 

We now live in a works of participatory theatre 

* in which we watch a performance   
* And simultaneously judge the performer 

We’re no longer content to sit in the audience and follow the story

* we want to go backstage   
* Examine the props and the rigging  
* Discover the story behind the story 

Narrativity is becoming less like a book

* and more like a jigsaw puzzle   
* That we put together by making connections   
* And recognising patterns 

It’s almost impossible for a company to tell  a consistent story 

* since there’s no single writer   
* And every member of the audience has a different viewing angle 

Customers don’t want to be told 

* they want to tell 

They long to be heroes of their own journey 

Marketers need to pull back on storytelling 

* and focus on storyframing 

Story framing is the discipline of

* building a structure that lets customers create their own narrative 

It provides the boundaries that keep the story contained 

* the basic framework includes the POV of the company   
* It’s purpose   
* Onliness   
* And values 

Plus the I AM of the customer 

* Personal Identify   
* Customer aims   
* Tribal mores 

Out of the framework comes 

* A range of encounters   
* Or touch points   
* Through which customers can find personal meaning and growth 

The job of the company is to keep the framework alive 

* while encouraging and applauding it’s customers 

Without Profluence: 

* Brands lose momentum and customers lose interest 

When all the stories of all the customers are Woven together 

* they make one big story 

The big story should impart a feeling if “Profluence”

* A word coined by writer John Gardener   
* To describe the forward flow of a narrative   
* The feeling that the story is going somewhere 

How will your customers tell their stories? 

* Will they be able to create Profluence in their own lives? 

Every story has an arc:

* in the beginning the arc is the customers journey   
* From a first awareness of product   
* To (in best outcome) an authentic commitment to the brand 

When the arc of all the customers are taken together: 

* they add up to an overall arc

All we need arc is a way to progress

From Purchase Funnel to Brand Ladder 

In the pre-flip days of marketing 

* the important number to watch was sales   
* Not just current sales, but projected sales 

Which you could estimate by tracking customers:

* as they moved on the customer journey map  
* From awareness to interest   
* To consideration  
* To intent   
* To evaluation   
* And finally purchase 

The measure model called purchase funnel, is only helpful if: 

1. Your main goal is to project sales   
2. Customers move toward their purchase purchase predictable stages   
3. Current revenues are more important than brand building   
4. Acquiring customers is more important than keep them   
5. Or you have no use for non-customers 

There are a lot of “if’s” here 

* Most of which no longer pan out 

For example;

* in a time of accelerating change   
* Short term revenues don’t predict long term   
* Or even medium term success 

Purchase Funnel

* Awareness   
* Interest   
* Consideration   
* Intent   
* Evaluation   
* Purchase 

Today the part to purchase is non-linear and immediate 

* customers no longer purchase in predictable stages   
* On today’s e-commerce websites 

All the stages of the sales funnel 

* Can reside in the same place 

The funnel image is wrong from a company perspective 

* instead of stuffing people into a funnel   
* To squeeze profits   
* Companies should be empowering customers, so they can help build the brand 

This is not to say that: 

* Monthly and quarterly revenues are not important   
* Just that monthly and quarterly revenues are more sizeable   
* More profitable and more dependable   
* When you focus on long-term relationships instead of short-term

**Marketers need to set aside the funnel & pick up the ladder:**

The Brand Commitment Scale (BCS)

- Or Customer Ladder  
- Is a simple tool for measuring the progress of a brand from customer satisfaction  
- To customer empowerment 

The BCS puts emphasis where it belongs:

- On the customer

It offers a clear metric:

- As to how a company is doing at each level  
- The object is to get as many customers as possible up the ladder to the top

Level 1: Satisfaction

- Measured through the J.D Powers surveys

Level 2: Delight

- Forrester Research measures delight with its Customer Experience Index  
- And so does Bain & Company with its Net Promoter Score

Level 3: Customer Engagement

- When a customer is truly engaged with a brand  
- He or she enrols in the tribe

With Membership comes increasing loyalty

- Escalating repurchase habits  
- And an emotional attachment that goes far beyond patronage

This is where the brand becomes

- A building block in the customer’s identity, success, well-being   
- And even fulfilment

Havas’ Meaningful Brands Index (MBi)

- Has shown that top brands in this metric out performs the stock market by 120%

Level 4: Customer Empowerment

- This is the level where customers incorporate your brand into the deepest parts of their lives

They may depend on it for emotional support:

- For social status  
- For personal growth  
- Or even business success

Empowered Customers Will:

- Move heaven and earth to ensure your success  
- Happily, attract others to the tribe with their magnetic sense of commitment 

One Measure of the commitment is:

- The Stengel 50  
- Developed by former P\&G marketer Jim Stengel  
- Along with Millward Brown Optimar  
- Its s list of 50 brands with the deepest customer relationships
