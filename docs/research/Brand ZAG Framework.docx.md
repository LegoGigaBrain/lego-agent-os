**Marty’s Brand ZAG:** Radical Differentiation Framework

To Deploy Radical differentiation, you’ll need to master four disciplines:

- Finding your ZAG  
- Designing your ZAG  
- Building your ZAG  
- Renewing your ZAG

**Find your ZAG:** Positioning

“Hit them where they ain’t”: Differentiation

- Learn to find the spaces between the fielders  
- Find open market space

What other offerings are missing from the brandscape?

- Brandscape \= Landscape of category the brand participates in

**Uncover a need state:** Tool for finding white space

- Look for a job people are already trying to get done   
- and then help them do it

**Positioing Questions**

- What is our category  
- How do we compete?  
- Who are our customers?  
- Where do they live?  
- Why do they need us?  
- When do they need us?

**“Find a parade”:** Find a trend

Brands get an extra boost when they are powered by a trend:

- Starbucks got a boost from the trend towards a more European lifestyle  
- The Apple iPod got a boost from the trend toward online music sharing  
- Charles Shwab got a boost from trend towards more customized personal investing  
- Whole Foods & Trader Joe’s got a boost from the trend toward organic living

If you want to be a leader of something:

- Find a parole and get Infront of it

Four layers of a brand:

- Focus  
- Differentiation  
- Trend   
- Communications

**Branding Building:** Isn’t a series of isolated activities

- But a complete system in which five disciplines combine to produce a sustainable competitive advantage:  
1. Differentiation  
2. Collaboration  
3. Innovation  
4. Validation  
5. Cultivation

**ZAG:** The system of differentiation in the system of brand building

The process of designing your ZAG/Differentiating

- As Herbert Simon once said  
- “Everyone designs who devices courses of actions aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones”

The preferred situation in this case is:

- A compelling brand based on radical differentiation

The Course of action is:

- A brand strategy that ZAGs

All Design relies on heuristic thinking more than algorithmic thinking:

- Meaning that there is no set path  
- No mathematical formula   
- For reaching your goal  
- But you still need rigor & process, otherwise you’ll drift away

**FOCUS**

Checkpoint 1: **Who are you?**

The first step in building a brand is to look inside and see where the raw energy will come from

White Space has little value without experience, credibility, and passion needed to fuel success:

- Day after day  
- Year after year  
- Under the pressure of competition 

Josephy Campbell’s Advice is to: “Follow your bliss”

- This applies as much to companies as it does to individuals

What About your company?

- Where’s your passion?

Exercise: Obituary 

- 25 years from now your company has gone out of business  
- Task: write a glowing obituary, extolling its contributions to the world (45min) (normally)  
- It has to be big, bold and courageous  
- Suspend judgment about what’s realistic

Read Obit and read it out loud: Ask Questions

- Why don’t we do this?  
- Does it seem crazy because its so far from where we are now?  
- We have 25 years to accomplish something of this magnitude, what is stopping us?  
- Is there anything physically or logically impossible about these goals?  
- Lets keep thinking big

What would you like posterity to say about you?

You’ll find that the answers are also the answers to the seminal question:

- Who are you?  
- Where does your passion lie?  
- What gets you up in the morning

Checkpoint 2: **What do you do?**

CORE PURPOSE  
\- Next you need to clarify what business you’re in

Core Purpose according to “Built to last” authors:

- Jim Collins & Jerry Porras  
- Is the fundamental reason your company exist beyond making money

**CORE PURPOSE:** the reason your company exist beyond making money

- It’s the one thing that will never change about your business

**For Example:**

- Google’s stated purpose: is to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible

- Disney’s purpose: is to make people happy


These are very different companies, but what they have in common is:

- A clear sense of who they are  
- And why they are doing what they do

Without a clear sense of purpose:

- Companies tend to grab at short-term gains  
- Incurring long term loss of their identities

**Purpose Statement:**

- How many words will it take to articulate your purpose?  
- If it takes more 12 words, go back to checkpoint 1  
- Or set it aside and return back later


New Wine Bar Example: Purpose Statement knitted in 7 words

- “To bring people together through wine education”  
- While someday they could make small adjustments to their purpose  
- They have agreed on a differentiating idea (education) 

Checkpoint 3: **What is your vision?**

A company’s core purpose gives it a heading

- A direction toward the future

While a company’s purpose can be abstract

- A company’s vision should be concrete

**A VISION:**

- It is a picture of the future  
- An illustration of the future   
- A picture shared by the entire company

“A soul never thinks without an image” said Aristotle 

- And a company never acts without an image  
- To me this is The Word  
- The Word of God doesn’t come out of sound but out of light  
- It is the light that releases the sound  
- The Word is visual then the picture speaks a thousand words  
- This is by Tlotlego Maboe

**TRUE VISION**

- True vision can’t be imposed on a company  
- It has to grow from the shared purpose and passion of its people  
- ME: True vision cant be imposed on a business or company, it has to stem from the seat of responsibility (government) that has a purpose and a function which was given by YHVH. 

The leader’s job is to shape and articulate that vision:

- Making it palpable  
- Memorable  
- Inspiring

True vision leads to commitment rather than compliance. Confidence rather than caution  
Peter Senge in “The Fifth Discipline”: vividly explained the relationship between purpose and vision:

- Referring to the Kennedy years he said…  
- A purpose is “advancing man’s capabilities to explore the heavens”  
- A vision on the other hand is “A man on the moon by the end of the 1960’s “  
- Everyone could picture that man, up there on the moon. Planting the flag in the soft sand

Without a clearly drawn vision, it is dangerous to empower people

- It only leads to confusion, anxiety and distrust  
- As employees work at cross-purposes, often taking refuge in functional silos  
- Instead of collaborating to transform a shared picture of the future into reality

How do you shape a vision?

- Write it down as a speech

When you put your vision on paper

- You can immediately see its flaws  
- Then you can reinforce it to withstand the slings and arrows that test the resolve of any organization

**TRENDS**

What trends can you ride?

- The variety is virtually endless  
- Since each industry, region and subculture spawns its own trends

Examples of Trends:

- Volkswagen: with its new “transparent” factory and car recycling facility, responding to the climate change trend

- Samsung: with high design gadgets, responding to 4th industrial revolution trend  
    
- Dean & Dulca: with gourmet groceries/ Woolworths with sustainable and organic living


When you look under the hood of a high-performance brand:

- You almost always find that it is powered by a trend  
- See BIGGER THAN THIS BOOK

Trend power is increased when a brand rides more than one trend at a time  
Lets use the New Wine Bar for example:

- Democratization of wine  
- International travel  
- Sustainable farming  
- Affordable luxury  
- Gourmet food

With a little more work, it could also ride:

- Integrated technology  
- Experience Design  
- Self-service  
- Duty-free shipping

It could also ride micro-trends

- The trend towards low period wines  
- Location specific wines  
- Or cork less packaging

Trends are the tides that lift all brand

- See page 60 for picture of wave trends

**DIFFERENTIATION**

Checkpoint 5: **Who Shares the brandscape?**

**A brand does not exist in a vacuum**

- The passion, purpose and vision that drive a company may vertically be identical with those of competitors

You’ve probably see the list of core values that companies publish

- To help them define their cultures

When you look at these lists across an industry

- They appear to be selected from a short list of similar 12 virtues

Our company’s culture is:

- Innovative  
- Market driven  
- Customer focused  
- Ethical   
- Responsive  
- Collaborative  
- Trusted  
- Quality-minded  
- Progressive  
- Proactive  
- Responsible & Optimistic

While these vitues are admirable

- Differentiating requires that a company define itself by what makes it unique  
- Not what makes it admirable

MARKET ANALYSIS:

Every competitive category has its winners and loser

- In branding building, winning and losing is relative  
- Since there may be room for three, four or even more brand to exist profitable in one category

What’s especially interesting about competitive categories is:

- How they tend to arrange themselves into predictable hierarchies

Competitive Predictable Hierarchies in a mature category

- What you often find is that:

- The number one brand has roughly twice the market share of the number two brand  
    
- Number two brand has roughly twice the market share of the number three brand  
    
- Which has roughly twice the share of number four  
    
- And so on, and so on until there is no share left


  
In categories that support more competitors

- The differential between the market share is less dramatic  
- But the hierarchy is still in tact

In the world of power laws (laws that explain why success attracts success)

- Market share hierarchies are controlled by customers  
- Who collectively determine the success order of competitiors

Success order, in turn, is determined by two factors:

- The “Birth Order” of competitors

Which include the much-touted:

- “First mover advantage”  
- “Preferential attachment” (Popularity)

**POSITIONING** 

As positioning experts Jack Trout & Al Ries have often stated:

- The biggest winner is not the brand that’s first into the market-place  
- But the one that’s first into people’s minds

**Positioing Questions**

- What is our category  
- How do we compete?  
- Who are our customers?  
- Where do they live?  
- Why do they need us?  
- When do they need us?

Positioning Statement Framework inserted here\!

Checkpoint 6: **“What makes you the only”**

Framework for Onliness

- “Our brand is the only (category) that (description)”

In the first blank:

- Put the name of your category  
- E.g: “frozen yoghurt”, “furniture dealership”, “computer repair services”

In the second blank:

- Describe your zag/differentiation  
- E.g: “that tastes like naples”  
- “That sells sustainably manufactured furniture”  
- “That makes house calls”

If you can’t keep it brief

- And can’t use the word only  
- Then you don’t have a zag

Your best option in that case is to make a list of all the competitors who could make the same claim:

- Then start to shift your strategy from theirs  
- Remember the aim is not merely differentiation, but radical differentiation

Onliness is the true test of radical differentiation:

- If you can’t say that you’re the “only”, then go back and start over

Here is a more detailed version of the exercise to help you pinpoint your onliness:

- What is your category?  
- How are you different?  
- Who are your customers?  
- Where are they located?  
- When do they need you?  
- And why are you important?

With this framework you uncover:

- You not only get the category (what)  
- And point the of differentiation (how)  
- But also segment the audience (who)  
- Narrow your market geography (where)  
- Focus on a need state (why)  
- And define the underlying trend (when)

**ONLINESS**

An onliness statement provides a framework for your ZAG

Once you’ve defined your point of differentiation:

- You have decisional filter for all your company’s future decisions

By checking against your onliness statement you can quickly see whether:

- Any new decision will help or hurt  
- Focus or unfocus  
- Purify or modify your brand

**FOCUS**

Checkpoint 7: **What should you add or substract?**

One of the most powerful elements in building a brand is focused alignment:

- Unfortunately, it’s a principle that is not celebrated or honored much

Why?

- Because humans are more adapt at adding elements than subtracting them

We love starting new initiatives and building, building, building

- We hate being told not   
- And feeling limited

The principle of alignment, by contrast:

- Is best served by extreme focus and self-discipline

Brand alignment is the practice of:

- Linking your business strategy to customer experience  
- Aligning all your company behaviors behind a clearly articulated radical differentiation

There should be no leftover part:

- No maverick offerings  
- No contradiction  
- Between what you say \+ what you do

The result of alignment is coherence

- The result of non-alignment is wasted resources

Remove elements from the brand that might decrease the focus of the brand:

- Or remove things that will allow brand to increase focus  
- Vice versa: only add elements that increase – not decrease the focus of the brand

The rule of thumb is simple:

- If adding an element to your brand brings you into competition with a stronger competitor, think twice  
- You may well end up wasting energy and confusing your customer 

Lou Gerstner, former CEO of IBM was fond of saying:

- “If you don’t know where you’re going, any direction will get you there”

Checkpoint 8: **Who loves you?**

Every brand is built by a community:

- Not just the community of people inside the company  
- But its partners, suppliers, investors, customers, non-customers  
- And even competitors

It’s a complete ecosystem in which there are gives and gets all around

- Everyone has a role to play and everyone should be repaid for their efforts

QUESTION: What will the customers get from joining the tribe?

- How about the employees  
- What about the partners, suppliers, investors?

**COMMUNICATIONS**

Checkpoint 9: **“Who’s your enemy?”**

Brand history abounds with evidence that David can take on goliath and win

- Avis taking on Hertz  
- Apple taking on INM  
- The tiny Mini taking on the giant SUVS

Everyone can’t be your friends:

- Rather than trying to please everyone at the risk of pleasing no one  
- Step right up and stand for something even if its an unpopular opinion

Sometimes the enemy is not a competing company:

- But the old way of thinking or doing things  
- Point it out

The goal is not to topple the big guys:

- But to employ the principle of contrast   
- To throw your differentiation into sharp relief

Checkpoint 10: **What do they call you?**

A name should be:

- Different than those of competitors  
- Brief-four syllables or less  
- Appropriate, but not so descriptive that it sounds generic  
- Easy to spell  
- Satisfying to pronounce  
- Suitable for “brandplay”  
- Legally defensible

Checkpoint 11: **How do you explain yourself?**

All brand communications should emanate from an internal positioning trueline

A Trueline is:

- The one thing you say about your brand  
- Based on your onliness statement 

It must be something your customers/competitors can’t claim or won’t

In a nutshell:

- Your trueline is your value proposition  
- The reason your brand matters to customers

Customer Facing Tagline:

- Once you have your trueline  
- It’s a short step to a customer facing tagline  
- Its simply translating your trueline into a more polished form

The key to crafting a Trueline & Tagline:

- Is to focus on a single proposition  
- If you find yourself using commas or “ands” to write your tagline  
- You may need more focus

The Rule: One proposition per brand

Examples of Truelines & Taglines:

- A. G. Edwards: Takes a personal interest in your nest egg. “Fully invested in our clients”

- Citibank: knows that money is only a means to happiness. “Live Richly”  
    
- Audi makes cars for people who take the road less travelled. “ NEVER FOLLOW”  
    
- Charles Shwab is not just a company, but a real person. “TALK TO CHUCK”  
    
- Nike helps you find your inner athlete. “JUST DO IT”  
    
- Earthlink gives you services that make e-mail easier. “EARTHLINK REVOLVES AROUND YOU”  
    
- Lending Tree rounds up online bids from lenders. “WHEN BANKS COMPETE, YOU WIN”


  
Checkpoint 12: **How do you spread the word?**

Touchpoints:

- The places where your customers will come into contact with your brand  
- So they become true believers and spread the word to their friends

Use one voice across all platforms

- The places where customers will experience the brand

It starts with differentiation:

- Then aligning all the customer experience with the zag

Checkpoint 13: **How do people engage with you?**

Before you can align your touchpoints:

- You have to define what you’re selling  
- And how you are going to sell it

You’ll find that in building your ZAG:

- You will want to give away items that your customers sell at a profit  
- Or you will find that your competitors are beating each other up by competing in the same way  
- Or in the same areas

What can you offer that competitors cannot or won’t?

- Rule to follow: when mapping your value proposition, forget about so-called best practices  
- Best practices are common practices

Checkpoint 14: **What do they experience?**

While strategy is a powerful discipline:

- Without good execution, strategy is only a plan (an intention)  
- Faith without action is dead

Translate strategic plan into compelling customer experience:

- Material faith by acting on it

Customer Experience

- Customers will experience your brand at various touchpoints

Choosing what those touchpoints are and influencing what happens there

- Is very important

The best way to start choosing and influencing your touchpoints

- Is by Mapping your customers journey  
- From awareness to loyalty 

Customer Journey Map:

- How will they learn about you?  
- How will you help them “enrol” in your brand?  
- Who or what will be your competition at each touchpoint  
- Where should you put your marketing resources?  
- More to the point, where should you not put them?

Prioritize each touchpoint according to:

- Their potential for alignment  
- Less important touchpoints would receive less funding  
- And others, especially those used heavily by competitors

Every brand is built with experiences:

- Whether the brand is a company, product or a service  
- And whether it serves individuals or businesses

The key is to craft those experiences:

- So they create a delight for the people who determine the meaning and value of your brand  
- Your customers

Checkpoint 15: **How do you earn their loyalty?**

For brand loyalty to grow, it must be earned:

- It must be mutual

As adman David Ogilvy famously observed:

- “Any damn fool can put on a deal, but it takes genius, faith and perseverance to create a brand”

Six reasons for encouraging customer loyalty: when customers are loyal:

1. They stop considering other brands  
2. They request your brand by name  
3. They recommend your brand to others  
4. They wait longer and travel farther to get your brand   
5. They accept brand extensions more readily  
6. And they continue to pay a premium price

- Scott M. Davis & Michael Dunn in their book “building the brand driven business”

**FOCUS**

Checkpoint 16: **How do you extend your success?**

The thorniest question in brand strategy is, how to keep growing?

**There are two main models for organizing brand portfolio:**

1st is “House of Brands”:

- Meaning a company that markets a range of separate brand names  
- Here individual brands are given the spotlight  
- While the company stays behind the scene (Procter & Gambler)

2nd is “Branded House”:

- Meaning that the company itself is the brand  
- And its products or services are subsets of the main brand (Hewlett-Pachard)

Checkpoint 17: **How do you protect your portfolio?**
