# LEGO Agent OS — Manual

A reusable, modular multi-agent operating system for Claude Code.
Designed for world-class software development, brand strategy, marketing, Solidity protocol work, backend systems, UX flows, documentation, and automated spec-driven execution.

LEGO OS gives you:
- A multi-layer context system
- Agents that act as senior specialists
- Skills that enforce standards
- Commands that orchestrate multi-agent workflows
- Templates that bootstrap mission, roadmap, tech-stack, and feature specifications
- A context-sync engine that keeps everything up to date

---

## 1. What LEGO OS Is

A fully structured, high-discipline development environment that turns Claude Code into:
- A senior engineering team
- A protocol design lab
- A product & UX department
- A brand strategy agency
- A marketing department
- A specification engine
- A documentation factory
- A continuous reviewer

It runs on 3 layers.

---

## 2. The 3-Layer Context Model (Standards → Product → Specs)

### Layer 1 — Standards: HOW we build

Located under:
```
standards/global/*
standards/backend/*
standards/frontend/*
standards/security/*
standards/docs/*
standards/signalos/*
.claude/skills/*
```

Standards define:
- Naming conventions
- Code style
- Data modelling
- API design
- UX & design principles
- Security principles
- Smart contract audit standards
- Test authoring patterns
- Doc-writing principles
- Brand strategy methodology (SignalOS™)
- Marketing frameworks

Agents must obey standards unless explicitly overridden.

### Layer 2 — Product: WHAT we are building

Autogenerated from:
```
product-templates/mission.template.md
product-templates/roadmap.template.md
product-templates/tech-stack.template.md
product-templates/changelog.template.md
```

Created and updated via:
- `/product-plan`
- `/context-sync`

Resulting in:
```
docs/project/mission.md
docs/project/roadmap.md
docs/project/tech-stack.md
docs/project/changelog.md
```

These define:
- The purpose
- The long-term direction
- The system architecture decisions
- How the product will evolve over time

### Layer 3 — Specs: WHAT we are building next

Autogenerated from:
```
spec-templates/feature-spec.template.md
spec-templates/tasks-breakdown.template.md
spec-templates/verification-checklist.template.md
```

Created via:
- `/spec-and-plan`

(and kept up-to-date via `/context-sync`)

Resulting in feature folders:
```
docs/specs/<feature>/
  feature-spec.md
  tasks-breakdown.md
  verification-checklist.md
```

This layer powers:
- Implementation
- Code review
- Security audits
- Verification
- Documentation

Everything is feature-driven and template-aligned.

## 3. Department Structure

LEGO OS organizes agents into functional departments:

| Department | Focus | Agents |
|------------|-------|--------|
| **Engineering** | Code, architecture, security | senior-architect, backend-engineer, solidity-protocol-engineer, security-auditor, defi-risk-engineer |
| **Design & UX** | Visual design, user experience | design-reviewer, design-strategist, visual-designer, ux-product-strategist, ux-writer |
| **Brand Strategy** | Brand positioning, archetypes | brand-strategist, archetype-analyst, brand-identity-architect |
| **Marketing** | GTM, growth, campaigns | marketing-strategist, vibe-marketer, growth-engineer |
| **Content & Social** | Content strategy, community | content-strategist, social-media-manager, community-manager |
| **Communication Design** | Verbal identity, copy | verbal-identity-designer, copywriter |
| **Business Strategy** | Strategy, research | business-strategist, research-analyst |
| **Documentation** | Docs, context management | docs-writer, context-steward |
| **Code Review** | Code quality, security | pragmatic-code-reviewer, security-review-agent |

**Total: 29 agents across 9 departments**

---

## 4. How to Create a New Agent

1. Duplicate `templates/TEMPLATE_AGENT.md`
2. Name the file: `.claude/agents/<agent-name>.md`
3. Fill:
   - Mission
   - Responsibilities
   - Workflow
   - Standards awareness
   - Skills references
4. Save — Claude Code loads it automatically.

Agents should represent senior specialists, not junior roles.

---

## 5. How to Create a New Command

1. Duplicate `templates/TEMPLATE_COMMAND.md`
2. Place it in `.claude/commands/`
3. Define:
   - Goal
   - Primary + supporting agents
   - Step-by-step workflow
4. Run via `/your-command`

Commands orchestrate multi-agent operations like:
- `/product-plan`
- `/spec-and-plan`
- `/context-sync`
- `/brand-strategy`
- `/gtm-strategy`
- `/smart-contract-review`
- `/verify-implementation`

---

## 6. How to Create a New Skill

1. Duplicate `templates/TEMPLATE_SKILL.md`
2. Place in `.claude/skills/`
3. Fill in:
   - Purpose
   - Checklists
   - Patterns to follow
4. Reference skills in appropriate agent specs.

Skills enforce standards across every agent.

## 9. Best Practices

- Keep CLAUDE.md files small, precise, layered.
- Use Explore → Plan → Execute for every workflow.
- For high-risk tasks:
  - Involve senior-architect
  - Involve security-auditor
  - Involve solidity-protocol-engineer
- For brand work:
  - Start with `/brand-strategy`
  - Use `/archetype-analysis` for depth
  - Apply SignalOS™ SYNC → PROGRAM → EMIT
- Prefer small, composable code changes.
- Update tests with every behavioural change.
- Update docs with `/write-docs` after major work.

---

## 10. MCP Integration

LEGO OS is MCP-ready.

Recommended MCPs:
- Playwright MCP (end-to-end UI testing)
- Filesystem / Git MCP (repo changes, commits)
- HTTP/Webhook MCP (API mocks, payment/onramp flows)
- ESLint/Prettier MCPs (lint/fix frontend code)
- Solidity compiler/formatter MCP (if available)

Document enabled MCPs inside:
- CLAUDE.project.md or project-specific CLAUDE.md
- Relevant agent specs (UX, backend, solidity)

---

## 11. Root Philosophy

LEGO OS is built around:
- Repeatable structure
- Template-driven specifications
- Clear agent responsibilities
- Disciplined code execution
- Context clarity
- Senior-level judgment
- Brand-strategy integration
- Marketing alignment

This is not a chatbot.
It is a full AI engineering and brand organization that you can drop into any repo.
