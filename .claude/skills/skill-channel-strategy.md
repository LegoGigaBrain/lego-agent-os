## Core Philosophy

> "Channel strategy is signal routing — choosing the paths that carry your frequency to the right ears."

Channel strategy is not about being everywhere. It's about:
- Being in the right places with the right signal
- Matching channel characteristics to audience behavior
- Orchestrating channels as a system, not silos
- Allocating resources for maximum impact
