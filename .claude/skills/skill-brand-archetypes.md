# Skill: Brand Archetypes

## Purpose

Map brands and founders to Jungian archetypal patterns for deeper resonance, consistency, and cultural power. Archetypes provide a universal language that connects brands to deep human motivations and storytelling patterns.

## Standards Awareness

Before applying this skill, ensure familiarity with:

- `standards/signalos/cultural-brands.md`

## Why Archetypes Matter

Every powerful brand has a personality archetype based on Jungian psychology. Archetypes:

1. **Create instant recognition** — They tap into universal human understanding
2. **Guide consistent decisions** — They provide a filter for all brand choices
3. **Enable deeper connection** — They resonate on a subconscious level
4. **Build cult followings** — The strongest brands (Disney, Harley, Apple) have clear archetypes
