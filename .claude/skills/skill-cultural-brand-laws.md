## The 6 Laws

Cultural brands master these six principles:

| Law | Principle |
|-----|-----------|
| 1. Myth-Making | Narrative > Product |
| 2. Symbolism | Icons compress meaning |
| 3. Rituals | Participation > Consumption |
| 4. Scarcity + Access | Status games drive desire |
| 5. Collaboration | Cross-pollination creates moments |
| 6. Reinvention | Morph with culture, preserve core |

---

## Law 1: Myth-Making

### Core Principle
The most powerful brands are built on myths, not features.

### Myth Components

| Component | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Origin | How it began | Apple in a garage |
| Hero | Who we serve | The underdog, the creator |
| Enemy | What we fight | The status quo, conformity |
| Quest | What we pursue | Making the world better |
| Transformation | What changes | Ordinary → Extraordinary |

### Myth Creation Process

**Step 1: Identify the Founding Myth**
- What origin story gives the brand its soul?
- What struggle was overcome?
- What vision drove the beginning?

**Step 2: Create the Hero's Journey**
- Position customer as hero
- Position brand as guide
- Define the transformation

**Step 3: Build Lore**
- Develop rich backstory
- Create reference points
- Enable storytelling

**Step 4: Make It Shareable**
- Stories spread; specs don't
- Emotional truth over factual detail
- Simple enough to retell

### Myth Template
```
ORIGIN: [How it started]
HERO: [Who we serve]
ENEMY: [What we fight against]
QUEST: [What we pursue]
TRANSFORMATION: [What changes when hero succeeds]
```

## Law 2: Symbolism

### Core Principle
Symbols compress meaning. The most powerful brands have symbols that carry entire worldviews.

### Symbol Types

| Type | Description | Purpose |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Primary mark | Main logo/icon | Recognition |
| Secondary marks | Supporting symbols | System depth |
| Cultural artifacts | Objects associated with brand | Tangible belonging |
| Meme-able elements | Visual hooks | Organic spread |

### Symbol Design Criteria

**Effective symbols are:**
- Recognizable at any size
- Meaningful (evoke values)
- Remix-able (invite participation)
- Systematic (part of visual vocabulary)

### Symbol Power Assessment

| Criteria | Score 1-5 | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Recognition | | |
| Meaning | | |
| Remix-ability | | |
| System fit | | |

### Symbol Development Process

1. **Audit current symbols** — What exists? What works?
2. **Define meaning** — What should symbols evoke?
3. **Design for remix** — How can community participate?
4. **Build system** — Create coherent visual vocabulary

---

## Law 3: Rituals

### Core Principle
Cultural brands create rituals — repeated behaviors that reinforce belonging.

### Ritual Categories

| Category | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Acquisition | How people first join | Unboxing experience |
| Usage | How people engage daily | Morning coffee ritual |
| Community | How the tribe gathers | Annual events, meetups |
| Passage | How people level up | Certifications, milestones |
| Celebration | How wins are marked | Victory posts, celebrations |

### Ritual Design Framework

For each ritual, define:

**Trigger:** What initiates the ritual?
**Routine:** What specific actions are performed?
**Reward:** What meaning or benefit is received?
**Investment:** What does the participant contribute?

### Ritual Audit Template

```
RITUAL NAME: [Name]
CATEGORY: [Acquisition/Usage/Community/Passage/Celebration]

TRIGGER: [What starts it]
ROUTINE: [What happens]
REWARD: [What's gained]
INVESTMENT: [What's contributed]

FREQUENCY: [How often]
PARTICIPANTS: [Who's involved]
ARTIFACTS: [Physical/digital elements]
```

### Creating New Rituals

1. **Identify moment** — Where could ritual add meaning?
2. **Design sequence** — What's the step-by-step?
3. **Add symbol** — What visual/physical element reinforces?
4. **Enable sharing** — How do participants share?
5. **Establish rhythm** — When does it recur?

---

## Law 4: Scarcity + Access

### Core Principle
Cultural brands master the tension between scarcity and access.

### Scarcity Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Time-limited | Available only at certain times | Drops, flash sales |
| Quantity-limited | Only X units exist | Limited editions |
| Qualification-limited | Must meet criteria | Members-only |
| Knowledge-limited | Must know to access | Hidden menus, codes |

### Access Tiers

Design levels of access that create aspiration:

| Tier | Access Level | Example |
|------|--------------|---------|
| Public | Anyone can see | Website, social |
| Follower | Anyone who subscribes | Email, community |
| Customer | Those who purchase | Product access |
| Member | Those who commit | Membership perks |
| Insider | Deep commitment | VIP access |
| Partner | Co-creation | Collaboration rights |

### The Scarcity Paradox

**Too much scarcity** = kills growth
**Too little scarcity** = kills desire

### Scarcity Design Questions

- What's scarce enough to create desire?
- What's accessible enough to enable growth?
- How do people advance to higher access?
- What signals higher status?

## Law 5: Collaboration

### Core Principle
Cultural brands grow through strategic collisions with other cultural forces.

### Collaboration Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Brand x Brand | Two brands merge audiences | Adidas x Gucci |
| Brand x Artist | Brand meets creative vision | LV x Yayoi Kusama |
| Brand x Culture | Brand enters cultural space | Nike x Hip-Hop |
| Brand x Community | Brand empowers creators | YouTube x Creators |

### Collaboration Assessment

Before collaborating, verify:

| Criteria | Check |
|----------|-------|
| Makes tribe proud | |
| Reaches new audiences authentically | |
| Creates something genuinely new | |
| Will be remembered (not just noticed) | |

### Collaboration Process

1. **Identify adjacencies** — What other worlds does tribe inhabit?
2. **Assess partners** — Alignment > audience size
3. **Define creation** — What new thing will exist?
4. **Protect authenticity** — Must make sense to both tribes
5. **Execute distinctly** — Neither could do it alone

### Collaboration Brief Template

```
COLLABORATION: [Brand] x [Partner]

STRATEGIC RATIONALE:
- Why this partner: [Alignment/reach/newness]
- What tribe gains: [Value to existing community]
- What's new: [What we create together]

OUTPUT:
- Product/experience: [What we're making]
- Distribution: [How it reaches audiences]
- Timeline: [Key dates]

SUCCESS METRICS:
- [How we'll measure]
```

## Law 6: Reinvention

### Core Principle
Cultural brands evolve with culture while maintaining essential identity.

### Core vs. Expression

| Element | Should Evolve | Should Stay Fixed |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| Visual | Typography, imagery, treatments | Core mark, primary colors |
| Voice | Slang, references, platforms | Tone, values, personality |
| Products | Features, formats, categories | Quality, core benefit |
| Position | Market context, competitors | Purpose, onliness |

### Reinvention Triggers

- Cultural shifts (new generations, movements)
- Technology change (new platforms, capabilities)
- Market evolution (new competitors, categories)
- Crisis moments (require adaptation or death)

### Reinvention Assessment

**Questions:**
- What has changed in culture that affects us?
- What should we evolve to stay relevant?
- What must we preserve to stay authentic?
- How do we change without losing identity?

### Reinvention Plan Template

```
TRIGGER: [What's changing]

CORE (PRESERVE):
- [Element 1]
- [Element 2]

EXPRESSION (EVOLVE):
- [Element 1] → [New version]
- [Element 2] → [New version]

TIMELINE:
- [When changes roll out]

COMMUNICATION:
- [How we explain to tribe]
```

## High-Virality Sparks Framework

Use this to generate culturally resonant content:

### Structure

```
PRINCIPLE: [Which of the 6 Laws]
HOT PROJECT: [Cultural object/brand/community that embodies it]
SPARK ANGLE: [Sharp content hook]
WHY VIRAL: [Psychological/cultural reason it spreads]
```

### Examples

**Example 1:**
```
PRINCIPLE: Law of Symbols
HOT PROJECT: Pudgy Penguins
SPARK ANGLE: "How a cartoon penguin became a cultural status symbol"
WHY VIRAL: Identity flex + meme repeatability
```

**Example 2:**
```
PRINCIPLE: Law of Rituals
HOT PROJECT: Nouns DAO
SPARK ANGLE: "The daily ritual that built a $50M community"
WHY VIRAL: Participation mechanism + onchain novelty
```

**Example 3:**
```
PRINCIPLE: Law of Scarcity
HOT PROJECT: Supreme
SPARK ANGLE: "Why waiting in line IS the product"
WHY VIRAL: Status game insight + contrarian retail take
```
