# Skill: Naming Systems

## Purpose

Create strategic naming systems for brands, products, features, and categories. This skill provides frameworks for developing names that are distinctive, ownable, and aligned with brand strategy.

## Standards Awareness

Before applying this skill, ensure familiarity with:
- `standards/signalos/brand-strategy.md`
- `standards/signalos/transmission-framework.md`

---

## Core Philosophy

> "A name is a compressed signal. Get it right, and it transmits meaning instantly. Get it wrong, and you're explaining forever."

Naming is not about creativity for creativity's sake. It's about:
- Capturing essence in minimal words
- Creating something ownable and defensible
- Building recognition and recall
- Supporting (not fighting) the brand strategy
