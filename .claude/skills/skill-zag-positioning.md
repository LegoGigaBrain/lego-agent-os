## The 17 Checkpoints

### FOCUS (Checkpoints 1-4)

#### Checkpoint 1: Who Are You?

**Purpose:** Find the raw energy that will fuel the brand

**Key Questions:**
- Where's your passion?
- What makes you get up in the morning?
- What would you want posterity to say about you?

**Exercise: The Obituary**
- Imagine: 25 years from now, your company has gone out of business
- Write a glowing obituary extolling its contributions to the world
- Make it big, bold, courageous — suspend judgment about what's realistic

**Questions After Writing:**
- Why don't we do this?
- Does it seem crazy because it's so far from where we are now?
- We have 25 years — what is stopping us?
- Is there anything physically or logically impossible about these goals?

**Output:** Clear understanding of core identity and passion

---

#### Checkpoint 2: What Do You Do?

**Purpose:** Clarify your core purpose

**Definition:** Core Purpose is the fundamental reason your company exists beyond making money.

**Criteria:**
- It's the one thing that will never change about your business
- It should take 12 words or fewer
- It should be specific enough to guide decisions

**Examples:**
- Google: "To organize the world's information and make it universally accessible"
- Disney: "To make people happy"

**Warning Signs:**
- If it takes more than 12 words, go back to Checkpoint 1
- If it could apply to any company, it's too generic

**Output:** Purpose statement (12 words or fewer)

---

#### Checkpoint 3: What Is Your Vision?

**Purpose:** Create a concrete picture of the future

**Distinction:**
- Purpose = abstract direction (heading toward the future)
- Vision = concrete picture (what the future looks like)

**Requirements:**
- True vision grows from shared purpose and passion
- It must be palpable, memorable, and inspiring
- It leads to commitment rather than compliance

**Example:**
- Purpose: "Advancing man's capabilities to explore the heavens"
- Vision: "A man on the moon by the end of the 1960s"

**Exercise: Vision Speech**
Write your vision as a speech. When you put it on paper, you can see flaws and reinforce it.

**Output:** Vision statement that is concrete and pictureable

---

#### Checkpoint 4: What Wave Are You Riding?

**Purpose:** Identify trends that can power the brand

**Principle:** Brands get an extra boost when powered by trends.

**Examples:**
- Starbucks → European lifestyle trend
- Apple iPod → Online music sharing trend
- Whole Foods → Organic living trend

**Trend Power Multiplier:**
Brands can ride multiple trends simultaneously:
- Primary trends (macro)
- Secondary trends (category-specific)
- Micro-trends (niche or emerging)

**Output:** List of 3-5 trends that power your brand

---

### DIFFERENTIATION (Checkpoints 5-8)

#### Checkpoint 5: Who Shares the Brandscape?

**Purpose:** Map the competitive landscape

**Warning:** Core values lists often look identical across an industry. Don't compete on:
- Innovative
- Customer-focused
- Quality-minded
- Ethical

These are admirable but not differentiating.

**Market Analysis Framework:**

Competitive hierarchies in mature categories:
- #1 brand has ~2x market share of #2
- #2 has ~2x market share of #3
- And so on...

**Positioning Truth (Trout & Ries):**
The biggest winner is not the brand first into the marketplace, but the one first into people's minds.

**Output:** Competitive map showing positions and white space

---

#### Checkpoint 6: What Makes You the Only?

**Purpose:** Define your onliness — the true test of radical differentiation

**The Onliness Statement Framework:**

```
"Our brand is the ONLY [category] that [differentiator]"
```

**First blank:** Category (frozen yogurt, furniture dealership, computer repair)
**Second blank:** Your ZAG (that tastes like Naples, that sells sustainably manufactured furniture, that makes house calls)

**Rules:**
- If you can't keep it brief, you don't have a ZAG
- If you can't use the word "only," you don't have a ZAG
- If competitors can make the same claim, you don't have a ZAG

**Extended Framework:**
- What is your category? (What)
- How are you different? (How)
- Who are your customers? (Who)
- Where are they located? (Where)
- When do they need you? (When)
- Why are you important? (Why)

**Output:** Onliness statement using the "only" framework

---

#### Checkpoint 7: What Should You Add or Subtract?

**Purpose:** Achieve focused alignment

**Principle:** Brand alignment is linking business strategy to customer experience, aligning all behaviors behind radical differentiation.

**Rules:**
- No leftover parts
- No maverick offerings
- No contradiction between what you say and what you do

**The Add/Subtract Test:**
- If adding an element brings competition with a stronger competitor, think twice
- Only add elements that increase focus
- Remove elements that decrease focus

**Lou Gerstner's Law:**
"If you don't know where you're going, any direction will get you there."

**Output:** List of what to add and what to subtract for sharper focus

---

#### Checkpoint 8: Who Loves You?

**Purpose:** Map your brand community

**The Brand Ecosystem:**
- People inside the company
- Partners and suppliers
- Investors
- Customers
- Non-customers
- Competitors

Everyone has a role; everyone should be repaid.

**Questions:**
- What will customers get from joining the tribe?
- What about employees?
- What about partners, suppliers, investors?

**Output:** Stakeholder map with value exchange for each

---

### COMMUNICATIONS (Checkpoints 9-15)

#### Checkpoint 9: Who's Your Enemy?

**Purpose:** Define what you stand against

**Principle:** David can take on Goliath and win (Avis vs. Hertz, Apple vs. IBM, Mini vs. SUVs).

**The Enemy Framework:**
- Sometimes the enemy is a competitor
- Sometimes it's the old way of thinking
- Point it out

**Goal:** Not to topple the big guys, but to use contrast to throw differentiation into sharp relief.

**Warning:** Everyone can't be your friend. Standing for something means standing against something.

**Output:** Clear enemy statement (competitor or paradigm)

---

#### Checkpoint 10: What Do They Call You?

**Purpose:** Create a differentiating name

**Name Criteria:**
- Different from competitors
- Brief (4 syllables or less)
- Appropriate but not generic
- Easy to spell
- Satisfying to pronounce
- Suitable for "brandplay"
- Legally defensible

**Output:** Name evaluation or naming direction

---

#### Checkpoint 11: How Do You Explain Yourself?

**Purpose:** Create trueline and tagline

**Trueline:** The one thing you say about your brand, based on onliness statement. It must be something competitors can't or won't claim.

**Tagline:** Customer-facing translation of the trueline.

**Rules:**
- Focus on a single proposition
- If using commas or "ands," you need more focus
- One proposition per brand

**Examples:**
| Brand | Trueline | Tagline |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Nike | Helps you find your inner athlete | Just Do It |
| Audi | Makes cars for people who take the road less traveled | Never Follow |
| Charles Schwab | Is not just a company, but a real person | Talk to Chuck |

**Output:** Trueline (internal) and Tagline (external)

---

#### Checkpoint 12: How Do You Spread the Word?

**Purpose:** Identify brand touchpoints

**Definition:** Touchpoints are places where customers contact the brand and become true believers.

**Principle:** Use one voice across all platforms. Align all touchpoints with the ZAG.

**Output:** Touchpoint inventory and alignment assessment

---

#### Checkpoint 13: How Do People Engage with You?

**Purpose:** Define your value proposition delivery

**Key Questions:**
- What can you offer that competitors cannot or won't?
- What can you give away that competitors sell?
- Where are competitors beating each other up on the same things?

**Rule:** Forget "best practices" — best practices are common practices.

**Output:** Unique engagement mechanisms

---

#### Checkpoint 14: What Do They Experience?

**Purpose:** Design the customer experience

**Customer Journey Map Questions:**
- How will they learn about you?
- How will you help them "enroll" in your brand?
- Who or what will be competition at each touchpoint?
- Where should you put marketing resources?
- Where should you NOT put them?

**Prioritization:** Each touchpoint according to potential for alignment. Less important touchpoints receive less funding.

**Output:** Customer journey map with prioritized touchpoints

---

#### Checkpoint 15: How Do You Earn Their Loyalty?

**Purpose:** Design loyalty mechanisms

**Ogilvy's Law:** "Any damn fool can put on a deal, but it takes genius, faith and perseverance to create a brand."

**Six Reasons Loyal Customers Matter:**
1. They stop considering other brands
2. They request your brand by name
3. They recommend your brand to others
4. They wait longer and travel farther to get your brand
5. They accept brand extensions more readily
6. They continue to pay a premium price

**Output:** Loyalty strategy and mechanisms

---

### FOCUS RENEWAL (Checkpoints 16-17)

#### Checkpoint 16: How Do You Extend Your Success?

**Purpose:** Plan brand portfolio strategy

**Two Models:**

1. **House of Brands**
   - Company markets separate brand names
   - Individual brands get spotlight
   - Company stays behind the scenes
   - Example: Procter & Gamble

2. **Branded House**
   - Company itself is the brand
   - Products/services are subsets
   - Example: Apple, Google

**Output:** Brand architecture strategy

---

#### Checkpoint 17: How Do You Protect Your Portfolio?

**Purpose:** Defend and maintain differentiation

**Ongoing Questions:**
- Is onliness still unique?
- Are new competitors threatening the position?
- Has the market shifted?
- Are trends still relevant?

**Output:** Portfolio protection strategy
