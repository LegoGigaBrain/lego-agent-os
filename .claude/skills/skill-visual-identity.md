# Skill: Visual Identity

## Purpose

Design comprehensive visual identity systems including logo direction, color systems, typography, and visual language. This skill creates the visual operating system that ensures consistent brand expression.

## Standards Awareness

Before applying this skill, ensure familiarity with:
- `standards/signalos/transmission-framework.md`
- `standards/signalos/brand-strategy.md`

## Core Philosophy

> "Visual identity is brand signal made visible. Every element must transmit the same frequency."

Visual identity is not decoration. It's:
- Strategy made tangible
- Recognition built through consistency
- Emotion communicated instantly
- A system, not just a logo

---

## Visual Identity Components

### 1. Logo System

```
LOGO ARCHITECTURE:

PRIMARY LOGO:
- Full lockup (symbol + wordmark)
- Usage: Primary brand expression

SECONDARY VARIATIONS:
- Symbol only (for recognition contexts)
- Wordmark only (for formal contexts)
- Horizontal/Vertical variants

CLEAR SPACE:
- Minimum space around logo
- Based on logo element (e.g., height of letter)

MINIMUM SIZE:
- Print: [X]mm
- Digital: [X]px

COLOR VARIATIONS:
- Full color (primary)
- Mono (single color)
- Reversed (on dark backgrounds)
```

### 2. Color System

```
COLOR PALETTE:

PRIMARY COLORS:
- Primary 1: [Name] - [Hex] [RGB] [CMYK]
  Usage: [Where/how used]
- Primary 2: [Name] - [Hex] [RGB] [CMYK]
  Usage: [Where/how used]

SECONDARY COLORS:
- Secondary 1: [Name] - [Hex] [RGB] [CMYK]
  Usage: [Where/how used]

NEUTRAL COLORS:
- Background, text, UI elements

ACCENT COLORS:
- For highlights, CTAs, special moments

COLOR RATIOS:
- Primary: 60%
- Secondary: 30%
- Accent: 10%

ACCESSIBILITY:
- Contrast ratios for text
- Color blindness considerations
```

### 3. Typography

```
TYPE SYSTEM:

PRIMARY TYPEFACE:
- Name: [Font name]
- Usage: Headlines, hero text
- Weights: [Available weights]
- Character: [Personality description]

SECONDARY TYPEFACE:
- Name: [Font name]
- Usage: Body copy, UI
- Weights: [Available weights]
- Character: [Personality description]

TYPE SCALE:
- H1: [Size/weight/leading]
- H2: [Size/weight/leading]
- H3: [Size/weight/leading]
- Body: [Size/weight/leading]
- Caption: [Size/weight/leading]

TYPE PAIRING RULES:
- [Guidelines for combining typefaces]
```

### 4. Imagery Style

```
PHOTOGRAPHY STYLE:

MOOD:
- [Descriptor 1]
- [Descriptor 2]
- [Descriptor 3]

SUBJECT MATTER:
- Do: [What to include]
- Don't: [What to avoid]

TECHNICAL:
- Lighting: [Preference]
- Color treatment: [Processing style]
- Composition: [Guidelines]

ILLUSTRATION STYLE:

APPROACH:
- [Style description]

CHARACTERISTICS:
- Line weight
- Color usage
- Level of detail
- Metaphor/literalness
```

### 5. Graphic Elements

```
SUPPORTING ELEMENTS:

PATTERNS:
- [Description of pattern system]
- Usage guidelines

ICONS:
- Style: [Outlined/Filled/etc.]
- Grid: [Sizing system]
- Stroke weight: [Consistency]

SHAPES/MOTIFS:
- [Brand shapes or recurring elements]

TEXTURES:
- [If applicable]
```

## Visual Direction Process

### Step 1: Strategy Extraction

Pull from brand strategy:
```
ARCHETYPE: [What personality to express]
VALUES: [What principles to visualize]
TENSION: [What contrast to show]
TRIBE: [What audience to appeal to]
POSITIONING: [What space to own]
```

### Step 2: Mood & Territory

Define visual territory:
```
MOOD BOARD TERRITORIES:

TERRITORY 1: [Name]
- Feeling: [Emotional description]
- References: [Visual examples]
- Why it fits: [Strategic rationale]

TERRITORY 2: [Name]
- Feeling: [Emotional description]
- References: [Visual examples]
- Why it fits: [Strategic rationale]
```

### Step 3: Design Principles

Establish guiding principles:
```
VISUAL PRINCIPLES:

PRINCIPLE 1: [Name]
- What it means: [Description]
- How it manifests: [Visual expression]
- Example: [Reference]

PRINCIPLE 2: [Name]
[Continue for 3-5 principles]
```

### Step 4: System Development

Build the components:
- Logo concepts
- Color exploration
- Typography selection
- Imagery direction
- Supporting elements

### Step 5: Application

Define how system applies:
- Digital (web, app, social)
- Print (collateral, packaging)
- Environmental (signage, space)
- Motion (animation principles)
