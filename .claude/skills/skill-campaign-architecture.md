## Standards Awareness

Before applying this skill, ensure familiarity with:
- `standards/signalos/transmission-framework.md`
- `standards/signalos/brand-strategy.md`
- `standards/signalos/vibe-marketing.md`

## Core Philosophy

> "A campaign is a coordinated signal burst across time and space."

Campaigns are not random acts of marketing. They are architected systems that:
- Amplify a specific signal at a specific moment
- Orchestrate multiple channels toward a unified outcome
- Create momentum through sequenced touchpoints
- Leave lasting impression beyond the campaign period

---

## Campaign Types

### 1. Launch Campaigns

**Purpose:** Introduce something new to the market
**Duration:** 2-8 weeks
**Intensity:** High burst, then sustained

**Typical Structure:**
- Pre-launch (tease, build anticipation)
- Launch (coordinated reveal)
- Post-launch (sustain, optimize)

### 2. Awareness Campaigns

**Purpose:** Expand brand reach and recognition
**Duration:** Ongoing or quarterly bursts
**Intensity:** Consistent presence

**Typical Structure:**
- Hero content (anchor pieces)
- Distribution (multi-channel spread)
- Reinforcement (repeated exposure)

### 3. Conversion Campaigns

**Purpose:** Drive specific action (signup, purchase)
**Duration:** 1-4 weeks
**Intensity:** Focused, urgent

**Typical Structure:**
- Hook (attention capture)
- Value (benefit presentation)
- Proof (social validation)
- CTA (action trigger)

### 4. Retention Campaigns

**Purpose:** Deepen relationship with existing users
**Duration:** Ongoing, lifecycle-based
**Intensity:** Personalized, triggered

**Typical Structure:**
- Trigger (user behavior or milestone)
- Value delivery (relevant content)
- Deepening (next level engagement)

### 5. Cultural Moment Campaigns

**Purpose:** Leverage external events or trends
**Duration:** Hours to days
**Intensity:** Rapid, opportunistic

**Typical Structure:**
- Moment identification
- Rapid response creation
- Distribution sprint
- Ride the wave

## The Campaign Architecture Framework

### Layer 1: Strategic Foundation

Before any creative work:

**Signal Clarity**
```
CAMPAIGN SIGNAL: [Single sentence of what we're transmitting]
TENSION LEVERAGED: [Cultural tension this addresses]
TRIBE TARGET: [Who specifically this is for]
SUCCESS DEFINITION: [What winning looks like]
```

**Strategic Questions:**
- What is the business objective?
- What is the marketing objective?
- What signal are we amplifying?
- Who is the primary audience?
- What action do we want them to take?
- How will we know if we succeeded?

### Layer 2: Campaign Concept

**The Big Idea**
Every campaign needs a central organizing concept:

```
CONCEPT NAME: [Working title]
CONCEPT ESSENCE: [One sentence description]
CONCEPT TENSION: [What makes it interesting]
CONCEPT EXPRESSION: [How it manifests]
```

**Concept Tests:**
- Is it ownable? (Could only our brand do this?)
- Is it expandable? (Can it work across channels?)
- Is it memorable? (Will people remember it?)
- Is it actionable? (Does it drive behavior?)

### Layer 3: Message Architecture

**Message Hierarchy:**

```
LEVEL 1 - TAGLINE
[5-7 words - the compressed campaign signal]

LEVEL 2 - HEADLINE
[Single sentence - the key promise or hook]

LEVEL 3 - SUBHEAD
[Expand on headline with specifics]

LEVEL 4 - BODY
[Full explanation and proof points]

LEVEL 5 - CTA
[Specific action to take]
```

**Proof Points:**
- What evidence supports the message?
- What social proof exists?
- What guarantees can we offer?
- What objections must we overcome?

### Layer 4: Channel Strategy

**Channel Selection Matrix:**

| Channel | Role | Message Weight | Content Type |
|---------|------|----------------|--------------|
| [Channel 1] | [Awareness/Convert/Retain] | [Primary/Support] | [Format] |
| [Channel 2] | [Role] | [Weight] | [Format] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Channel Roles:**
- **Awareness:** Reach new audiences (social, PR, paid)
- **Consideration:** Deepen interest (content, retargeting)
- **Conversion:** Drive action (landing pages, email)
- **Retention:** Reinforce (email, community)

**Channel Integration:**
- How do channels hand off to each other?
- What's the user journey across channels?
- How do messages adapt per channel?

### Layer 5: Content Matrix

**Content Requirements by Channel:**

```
CHANNEL: [Name]
FORMAT: [Type of content]
QUANTITY: [Number of pieces]
MESSAGE: [Channel-specific message]
CTA: [Channel-specific action]
ASSETS NEEDED: [Visual, copy, etc.]
```

**Content Types:**
- Hero content (anchor, high production)
- Hub content (medium effort, educational)
- Hygiene content (ongoing, necessary)
- Moment content (reactive, trend-based)

### Layer 6: Timeline & Sequencing

**Campaign Phases:**

```
PHASE 1: PRE-LAUNCH [Duration]
Objective: [Goal]
Activities: [What happens]
Key Moments: [Important dates]

PHASE 2: LAUNCH [Duration]
Objective: [Goal]
Activities: [What happens]
Key Moments: [Important dates]

PHASE 3: SUSTAIN [Duration]
Objective: [Goal]
Activities: [What happens]
Key Moments: [Important dates]

PHASE 4: OPTIMIZE [Duration]
Objective: [Goal]
Activities: [What happens]
Key Moments: [Important dates]
```

**Sequencing Principles:**
- Build anticipation before reveal
- Coordinate cross-channel timing
- Create momentum, not just moments
- Allow for real-time optimization

### Layer 7: Measurement Framework

**Metrics Hierarchy:**

```
BUSINESS METRICS (Ultimate success)
- Revenue impact
- Market share
- Brand equity

MARKETING METRICS (Campaign success)
- Reach

**Measurement Plan:**
```
METRIC: [Name]

SOURCE: [Where data comes from]
BASELINE: [Current state]
TARGET: [Goal]
FREQUENCY: [How often measured]
```
