## The Three Qualities of a Brand

A brand is a service, product, company, or person with:

1. **Soul** — The brand platform (the beating heart, the reason to exist)
2. **Attractive** — The brand atmosphere (the emotional aura, design, and voice)
3. **Smart** — The brand's usability (how easy it is to engage)

## The 5-Step Brand Development Process

```
1. Brand Platform → 2. Naming → 3. Identity → 4. Brand Atmosphere → 5. UI/UX Design
```

## Step 1: Brand Platform

### Definition

A brand platform is a layered and interconnected web held together by a core of company values. It helps you understand the what, how, who, and the all-important WHY.

### Critical Distinction

| Business Plan | Brand Platform |
|---------------|----------------|
| Goals and strategy over time | Target audience definition |
| Projected earnings | Formulate persona to speak to audience |
| Operational focus | Connection focus |

### Platform Components

#### A. Positioning

**Core Questions:**
- What makes your brand unique?
- Why will consumers be drawn to your product?
- How does the audience perceive your brand?

**Positioning Statement Formula:**
```
To [target audience]
Our product is the [category]
That provides [functional, symbolic, or experiential benefits]
Because [support/reason to believe]
```

**Critical:** The "because" (reason to believe) is often missing. It's the most important part — it's what differentiates on an emotional level.

**Positioning Categories:**
| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Functional | Solves a problem or provides tangible benefit | "A 10-year bumper-to-bumper warranty" |
| Symbolic | Provides belonging or self-image benefit | "For those who think different" |
| Experiential | Provides physical or mental stimulation | "The ultimate driving experience" |

#### B. Brand Identity Associations

Four sources of brand identity:

1. **Brand as Product**
   - Product lines, specific products
   - Attributes, quality, value
   - Functionality, aesthetics
   - User personality

2. **Brand as Organization**
   - Company philosophy
   - Brand attitude
   - Scope (local vs. global)

3. **Brand as Person**
   - Character traits
   - User relationship with brand
   - May be typified by leader/spokesperson

4. **Brand as Symbol**
   - Physical properties
   - Unique design
   - Logo/identity
   - Advertising campaign
   - Brand heritage

#### C. Points of Difference

**The "So-What Factor"**
If you're opening a coffee shop, ask: "So what? Isn't there a coffee shop on every corner? What makes mine different?"

**Good Selling Proposition:** "A 10-year bumper-to-bumper warranty" (specific, verifiable)
**Poor Selling Proposition:** "Quality customer service" (vague, duplicatable)

**Exercise:**
1. List features and attributes of your product/service
2. Compare with competitors in a Venn diagram
3. Note overlaps, competitor strengths, and your differentiation

#### D. Target Audience

**Demographics:**
- Gender, Age, Location, Ethnicity
- Income, Education, Mobility
- Home ownership, Marital status, Children

**Psychographics:**
- Values, Attitudes, Activities, Opinions
- A day in their life
- Brands they prefer
- Shopping behaviors
- Interests and concerns

**Key Questions:**
- Who really needs my product/service?
- What are their problems, wants, needs?
- How does their problem make them feel?

**Maslow's Hierarchy Application:**
| Need Level | Brand Requirement |
|------------|-------------------|
| Physiological | Basic utility, accessibility |
| Safety | Security, reliability, trust |
| Belongingness | Community, tribe, social proof |
| Esteem | Status, recognition, achievement |
| Self-Actualization | Transformation, purpose, meaning |

#### E. Competitive Analysis

**Competitor Profile Elements:**

**Background:**
- Location, offices, online presence
- History and timeline
- Business structure and ownership
- B2B relationships

**Products/Services:**
- Product line examination
- New launches and success rates
- Brand awareness and loyalty

**Branding:**
- Name, identity design
- Tagline and messaging
- Brand colors, UI/UX

**Marketing:**
- Customer base and loyalty
- Promotional strategies
- Social media presence
- Distribution, pricing

**Personnel:**
- Key staff and abilities
- Management style
- Employee morale and retention

#### F. Philosophy and Values

**Why Philosophy Matters:**
Great brands communicate on a deeper level. They are "a cause, not just a company."

**Key Questions:**
- Why does this brand exist?
- Is there a compelling story behind the brand?
- How could your brand experiment and grow?
- What does the world need that your brand is uniquely able to provide?

**Core Values Format:**
Set out value statements in three short, actionable sentences.

Examples:
- "Challenge the status quo"
- "Initiate innovation"
- "Proactively collaborate"

**Core Values Strategy:**
Assign one core value to each day of the week. Make it your goal to do something each day that turns the words into action.

#### G. Brand Architecture

**Two Models:**

1. **House of Brands**
   - Multiple separate brand names
   - Individual brands get spotlight
   - Company behind the scenes
   - Example: Procter & Gamble

2. **Branded House**
   - Company is the brand
   - Products are subsets
   - Example: Apple, Google

## Step 2: Naming

### Name Criteria (from ZAG)

- Different from competitors
- Brief (4 syllables or less)
- Appropriate but not generic
- Easy to spell
- Satisfying to pronounce
- Suitable for "brandplay"
- Legally defensible

### Naming Process

1. Generate broad list of options
2. Filter against criteria
3. Check availability (domain, trademark)
4. Test with target audience
5. Select and protect

---

## Step 3: Identity

### Identity Components

- Primary mark (logo)
- Secondary marks
- Color palette
- Typography system
- Photography/illustration style
- Iconography

### Identity Principles

- Should be recognizable at any size
- Should evoke core values
- Should enable remix and participation
- Should work across all touchpoints

---

## Step 4: Brand Atmosphere

### Atmosphere Elements

- Design language
- Voice and tone
- Emotional posture
- Sensory elements
- Cultural references

### The Voice

The company's voice must be:
- **Clear** — Easily understood
- **Consistent** — Same across touchpoints
- **Compelling** — Draws people in

The brand should have a distinctive personality that is woven through everything.

---

## Step 5: UI/UX Design

### For Tech/Digital

- User interface design
- User experience flows
- Interaction patterns
- Accessibility

### For Products

- Packaging design
- Product quality
- Unboxing experience

### For Services

- Service design
- Key offering structure
- Touchpoint experience

---

## Brand Personality Development

### Archetype Approach

Based on Jungian archetypes, define which archetype(s) your brand embodies. (See `skill-brand-archetypes.md`)

### Character Traits Exercise

List adjectives that describe your brand as a person:
- Innovative, Trustworthy, Playful, Sophisticated
- Rebellious, Nurturing, Adventurous, Wise
- etc.

### Obituary Exercise

Imagine your brand has died. Write an obituary listing:
- Accomplishments
- Legacy
- Impact on the world
- How it will be remembered

---

## Layer of Protection

Branding provides more than positioning, image, and voice — it provides **protection**.

| Startup | Brand |
|---------|-------|
| You buy if price is right | You fall in love |
| Interest fades | Love doesn't fade easily |
| Compete on price | Compete on meaning |

**Investment:** Both time and money into translating startup to brand at launch creates lasting protection against competitors.
