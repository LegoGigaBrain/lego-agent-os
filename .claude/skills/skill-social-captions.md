# Skill: Social Captions for Untethered

## Purpose

Write scroll-stopping captions, hooks, and titles for all Untethered social content. This skill ensures every piece of content has compelling copy that stops the scroll, pulls people in, and moves them toward sync (follow/subscribe).

---

## Standards Awareness

Before applying this skill, ensure familiarity with:
- `projects/untethered/brand/brand-voice.md`
- `projects/untethered/content/content-strategy.md`
- `standards/signalos/transmission-framework.md`

**Critical Rule:** NO em dashes in any copy. They signal AI-written text.

## Core Philosophy

> "The caption is the bridge between scroll and stop. Every word must earn the pause."

Untethered captions are:
- **Mystical but accessible** (spiritual depth, cultural language)
- **Provocative but inviting** (challenge without attack)
- **Confident but not arrogant** (authority from experience)
- **Short sentences** (punchy, scannable, memorable)

## Hook Types by Style

### REVEAL Style Hooks

For content that uncovers truth, pulls back the curtain.

```
FORMULAS:
"Here's what nobody tells you about [topic]..."
"[Scripture/Concept] doesn't mean what you think it means."
"The real reason [common belief] doesn't work..."
"What if [commonly accepted thing] is actually [reframe]?"
"This is what [authority figure] was actually saying about [topic]..."

EXAMPLES:
"Here's what nobody tells you about transformation."
"Peter's shadow didn't heal people. His aura did."
"The real reason your prayers feel empty."
"What if 'faith' was never about belief at all?"
"This is what Yeshua was actually saying about the kingdom."
```

### CHALLENGE Style Hooks

For content that confronts assumptions, flips scripts.

```
FORMULAS:
"Stop [doing common thing]. It's keeping you stuck."
"[Popular belief]? That's religion, not reality."
"Everything you learned about [topic] is backwards."
"You're not [common identity]. You never were."
"The church told you [X]. Here's the truth..."

EXAMPLES:
"Stop trying to 'grow your faith.' You're already complete."
"Spiritual warfare? That's religion, not reality."
"Everything you learned about prayer is backwards."
"You're not a sinner saved by grace. You never were."
"The church told you to fight the devil. Here's the truth."
```

### INVITE Style Hooks

For content that creates belonging, extends welcome.

```
FORMULAS:
"If you've ever felt like [pain point]..."
"This is for everyone who [experience]..."

"There's a reason you [experience]. Let me explain."
"Welcome to everyone just discovering this..."

"If you've ever felt stuck after leaving church..."
"This is for everyone who knows something is missing."
"You're not alone in feeling dry."
"There's a reason you left religion. Let me explain."

"I used to fight spiritual battles. Then I discovered I'd already won."
"The moment I realized my aura was my responsibility."
"This is my story of untethering."
"What 5 years outside the church taught me about God."

## Quality Checklist

Before posting any caption:

- [ ] Hook stops the scroll (first line is strongest)
- [ ] No em dashes anywhere
- [ ] Brand voice is present (mystical + grounded)
- [ ] Clear CTA or engagement prompt
- [ ] Hashtags are relevant and strategic
- [ ] Length is appropriate for platform
- [ ] Aura-native language used where natural
- [ ] No religious jargon that alienates

---

## Anti-Patterns

**Avoid:**
- Em dashes (use periods, commas, colons instead)
- Religious jargon that feels churchy ("blessed," "anointed," "glory hallelujah")
- Preaching tone (talking AT not WITH)
- Generic motivational quotes
- Too many hashtags (7-12 is ideal)
- Weak hooks that don't stop scroll
- CTAs that sound desperate ("Please follow!")
- Over-explaining (trust the content)

## Caption Batch Template

For producing multiple captions efficiently:

```
# [Content Title/Topic]

## Platform: [Instagram/TikTok/X/YouTube]

### Hook Options (Pick best):
1. [Hook A]
2. [Hook B]
3. [Hook C]

### Selected Caption:
[Full caption text]

### Hashtags:
[Hashtag string]

### Notes:
[Any production notes]
```

---

## Integration with Content Matrix

When creating captions for Notion:

1. Add caption to "Notes" or dedicated "Caption" property
2. Include hook line for quick reference
3. Tag with Style for voice consistency
4. Mark caption status: Draft, Ready, Posted

This ensures every content piece has ready-to-use copy when production time comes.
