## Core Philosophy

> "Social media is not a megaphone. It's a gathering place for your tribe."

Social strategy is not about being everywhere loudly. It's about:
- Being present where your tribe gathers
- Speaking in the platform's native language
- Building community, not just audience
- Creating signal, not noise

---

## Platform Selection Framework

### Step 1: Audience Mapping

Where does your tribe actually spend time?

```
AUDIENCE: [Primary persona]

PLATFORM PRESENCE:
- [Platform]: [% of audience active here]
- [Platform]: [% of audience active here]
- [Platform]: [% of audience active here]

BEHAVIOR PATTERNS:
- Discovery: [Where they find new brands]
- Engagement: [Where they interact]
- Community: [Where they belong]
```

### Step 2: Platform Fit Assessment

| Factor | Weight | Platform A | Platform B | Platform C |
|--------|--------|------------|------------|------------|
| Audience presence | 30% | [1-5] | [1-5] | [1-5] |
| Content fit | 25% | [1-5] | [1-5] | [1-5] |
| Brand voice fit | 20% | [1-5] | [1-5] | [1-5] |
| Resource match | 15% | [1-5] | [1-5] | [1-5] |
| Growth potential | 10% | [1-5] | [1-5] | [1-5] |
| **Score** | 100% | [Total] | [Total] | [Total] |

### Step 3: Platform Prioritization

```
PRIMARY PLATFORM(S): [1-2 platforms]
- Why: [Rationale]
- Investment: [Heavy]

SECONDARY PLATFORM(S): [1-2 platforms]
- Why: [Rationale]
- Investment: [Moderate]

EXPERIMENTAL: [0-1 platform]
- Why: [Hypothesis to test]
- Investment: [Light]

NOT NOW: [Platforms we're skipping]
