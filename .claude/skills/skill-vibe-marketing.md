- `standards/signalos/transmission-framework.md`
- `standards/signalos/brand-strategy.md`

## Core Philosophy

> "You don't need more content. You need a cultural frequency."

Vibe Marketing is the application of "vibe coding" principles to brand and content work:

- **Rapid experimentation** over lengthy planning cycles
- **AI-assisted ideation** for campaigns, copy, and visuals
- **Authentic, trend-aware messaging** that feels native to the platform
- **Iterative refinement** — ship fast, learn, adjust
- **Emotional resonance** over metrics-first approaches

---

## The Five Principles

### 1. Speed Over Perfection
Ship the first viable version. Learn from real feedback. Iterate.

**Application:**
- Create in 20 minutes, not 2 weeks
- Ship with 80% confidence
- Learn from market, not meetings
- Revision beats prediction

### 2. Platform-Native First
Every platform has a vibe. Content must feel native, not cross-posted.

**Application:**
- TikTok ≠ LinkedIn ≠ X ≠ Instagram
- Study platform culture before creating
- Adapt format, length, and tone
- Never copy-paste across platforms

### 3. Trend Surfing
Ride cultural waves while they're cresting. Trends have a half-life measured in days.

**Application:**
- Monitor trends daily
- Assess relevance to brand signal
- Move within hours, not days
- Know when to sit out

### 4. Authentic Voice
Audiences detect corporate polish instantly. Embrace rawness.

**Application:**
- Personality > polish
- Human > corporate
- Imperfect > sterile
- Real > rehearsed

### 5. Signal Amplification
The goal isn't content volume — it's signal clarity.

**Application:**
- One resonant piece > ten forgettable ones
- Quality of engagement > quantity of reach
- Right audience > big audience
- Depth > breadth

## The Vibe Marketing Process

### Step 1: Signal Check

Before creating anything, verify brand signal clarity:

**Questions:**
- What tension are we resolving?
- What frequency are we emitting?
- What does our tribe need right now?
- What's our language stack?

**If Unclear:**
Stop. Go back to brand strategy. Content without signal is noise.

### Step 2: Trend Scan

Rapidly assess the current cultural moment:

**Sources to Check:**
- Platform trending sections
- Relevant hashtags
- Creator accounts in your space
- Meme accounts
- Comment sections

**Assessment Questions:**
- Is this trend rising or falling?
- Does it fit our signal?
- Can we add value or just noise?
- What's the half-life? (hours? days?)

**Trend Fit Matrix:**

| Trend Fit | Brand Fit | Action |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| High | High | MOVE NOW |
| High | Low | Skip |
| Low | High | Create original instead |
| Low | Low | Skip |

### Step 3: Rapid Ideation

Generate ideas at volume (with AI assistance):

**Process:**
1. Set timer for 10 minutes
2. Generate 10+ concepts minimum
3. No judgment during ideation
4. Include wild ideas (they spark better ones)
5. Cross-pollinate formats and references

**Ideation Prompts:**
- "What would [brand voice] say about [trend]?"
- "How would our tribe react to [current event]?"
- "What's the contrarian take on [popular opinion]?"
- "What can only we say about this?"

### Step 4: Vibe Filter

Filter ideas through brand lens:

**Filter Questions:**
- Does this feel like us? (Voice check)
- Does this serve our tribe? (Value check)
- Does this amplify our signal? (Strategy check)
- Would this embarrass us tomorrow? (Risk check)
- Is this something only we can say? (Onliness check)

**Kill Criteria:**
- Feels off-brand
- Tries too hard
- Could be from any brand
- Doesn't serve the tribe
- Chases trend without adding value

### Step 5: Create & Ship

Create content quickly:

**Creation Checklist:**
- [ ] Hook is compelling (first line/second earns attention)
- [ ] Format matches platform
- [ ] Voice matches brand
- [ ] CTA is clear (if applicable)
- [ ] Visual direction noted (if applicable)

**Ship Mindset:**
- Done is better than perfect
- You can always iterate
- The market is the best editor
- Speed is a competitive advantage

### Step 6: Learn & Iterate

Observe and document:

**Track These Signals:**
- Saves (people want to return)
- Shares (people want others to see)
- Comments (people want to engage)
- DMs (people want to connect)
- Conversions (people want to act)

**Learning Questions:**
- What resonated? Why?
- What fell flat? Why?
- What can we remix/repeat?
- What should we avoid?

**Documentation:**
```
CONTENT: [brief description]
PLATFORM: [where posted]
SIGNAL: [what we hoped to amplify]
RESULT: [what happened]
LEARNING: [insight for next time]
```

BRAND ANGLE: [Our unique take]

PLATFORM: [Where to post]

```

## Anti-Patterns

### Never Do:
- "We're excited to announce..." (corporate speak)
- Cross-post identical content everywhere
- Over-produce to the point of losing soul
- Chase trends that don't fit brand signal
- Wait for perfection before shipping
- Focus on vanity metrics over signal metrics
- Copy competitors without adding unique value
- Be try-hard or cringe

### Warning Signs:
- Content could be from any brand
- You're explaining why it's relevant (it should be obvious)
- Multiple approvals needed (too slow)
- Feels safe (probably boring)
- No one internally finds it interesting

---

## Quality Checklist

Before shipping:
- [ ] Platform-native (not cross-posted)
- [ ] Hook is compelling (would you stop scrolling?)
- [ ] Aligns with brand signal and voice
- [ ] Serves the tribe (not just the brand)
- [ ] Has clear signal to watch
- [ ] Appropriate for brand to own this space
- [ ] Timing is right (trend still alive?)
- [ ] Passes the "would this embarrass us?" test

---

## Metrics That Matter

### Vanity Metrics (Use Sparingly)
- Follower count
- Likes
- Impressions

### Signal Metrics (Focus Here)
- Saves (want to return)
- Shares (want others to see)
- Comments (want to engage)
- DMs (want to connect)
- Conversions (want to act)

### Vibe Metrics (Qualitative)
- Are the right people engaging?
- Does the comment section feel like our tribe?
- Are we attracting believers or browsers?

## Integration with SignalOS™

Vibe Marketing is the **EMIT phase** in rapid-iteration mode:

1. **SYNC** (brand signal) must be clear first
2. **PROGRAM** (language stack) provides the voice
3. **EMIT** (vibe marketing) is fast, iterative transmission

**Critical:** Without the first two phases, vibe marketing becomes noise without signal. Always verify brand foundation before executing.
