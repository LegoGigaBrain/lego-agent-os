# Skill: Editorial Calendar

## Purpose

Build and maintain editorial calendars that ensure consistent, strategic content delivery across all channels. This skill provides frameworks for planning, scheduling, and managing content production workflows.

## Standards Awareness

Before applying this skill, ensure familiarity with:
- `standards/signalos/transmission-framework.md`
- `standards/signalos/brand-strategy.md`

## Core Philosophy

> "A calendar without strategy is just a schedule. A calendar with strategy is a growth engine."

An editorial calendar is not just dates and titles. It's:
- A strategic tool that ensures signal consistency
- A production management system
- A cross-team coordination mechanism
- A performance optimization feedback loop

## Calendar Architecture

### Calendar Layers

```
LAYER 1: STRATEGIC CALENDAR (Quarterly/Annual)
- Major campaigns and launches
- Seasonal themes
- Industry events
- Product milestones

LAYER 2: TACTICAL CALENDAR (Monthly)
- Content themes
- Pillar distribution
- Channel cadence
- Resource allocation

LAYER 3: OPERATIONAL CALENDAR (Weekly)
- Specific content pieces
- Production assignments
- Publishing schedule
- Engagement activities
```

### Calendar Views

**Master View:** All content across all channels
**Channel View:** Single channel focus
**Campaign View:** Campaign-specific content
**Team View:** Assignments and deadlines

## Building the Calendar

### Step 1: Foundation Setting

```
PLANNING HORIZON:
- Strategic: [Months ahead]
- Tactical: [Weeks ahead]
- Operational: [Days ahead]

CONTENT PILLARS:
- [Pillar 1]: [% of content]
- [Pillar 2]: [% of content]
- [Pillar 3]: [% of content]

CHANNELS:
- [Channel]: [Cadence]
- [Channel]: [Cadence]
- [Channel]: [Cadence]

FLEXIBILITY BUFFER:
[X%] reserved for reactive/trending content
```

### Step 2: Strategic Mapping

Plot the big picture first:

```
ANNUAL/QUARTERLY ANCHORS:

Q1:
- [Major event/launch]: [Date]
- [Seasonal theme]: [Timeframe]
- [Industry moment]: [Date]

Q2:
- [Major event/launch]: [Date]
- [Seasonal theme]: [Timeframe]
- [Industry moment]: [Date]

[Continue for Q3, Q4]
```

### Step 3: Monthly Theming

Assign themes that ladder up to pillars:

```
MONTH: [Month]
THEME: [Overarching theme]
PILLAR FOCUS: [Primary pillar]

CONTENT GOALS:
- [Goal 1]
- [Goal 2]

KEY DATES:
- [Date]: [What's happening]

CONTENT MIX:
- Hero: [Number] pieces
- Hub: [Number] pieces
- Hygiene: [Number] pieces
- Moment: [As relevant]
```

### Step 4: Weekly Planning

Specific content slots:

```
WEEK OF: [Date]
THEME: [Weekly focus if applicable]

MONDAY:
- [Channel]: [Content title] | [Type] | [Pillar] | [Owner]
- [Channel]: [Content title] | [Type] | [Pillar] | [Owner]

TUESDAY:
- [Channel]: [Content title] | [Type] | [Pillar] | [Owner]

[Continue for each day]

ENGAGEMENT ACTIVITIES:
- [Activity]: [Time allocation]

REACTIVE BUFFER:
- [Slots held for trending/timely content]
```
