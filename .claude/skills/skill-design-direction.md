## Core Philosophy

> "Design direction is not telling designers what to make. It's giving them the strategic foundation to make the right decisions."

Design direction:
- Translates strategy into visual territory
- Provides guardrails, not prescriptions
- Enables creative freedom within boundaries
- Ensures all design ladders up to brand

## Design Direction Components

### 1. Strategic Foundation

What the design must communicate:

```
DESIGN MUST EXPRESS:

ARCHETYPE: [How the personality shows visually]
VALUES: [How principles manifest visually]
POSITIONING: [How differentiation shows visually]
TRIBE: [What appeals to the audience visually]
TENSION: [What contrast/opposition to show]
```

### 2. Emotional Territory

The feeling design should evoke:

```
EMOTIONAL TERRITORY:

PRIMARY EMOTION: [Main feeling]
SUPPORTING EMOTIONS: [Secondary feelings]
EMOTIONAL JOURNEY: [How it should progress]

AVOID: [Emotions not aligned with brand]
```

### 3. Visual Territory

The aesthetic space to explore:

```
VISUAL TERRITORY:

DESCRIPTOR 1: [Visual quality]
What it means: [Explanation]
References: [Examples]

DESCRIPTOR 2: [Visual quality]
What it means: [Explanation]
References: [Examples]

[3-5 descriptors total]
```

### 4. Reference & Inspiration

Curated examples:

```
VISUAL REFERENCES:

REFERENCE 1:
[Description or link]
What to take: [Specific element]
What to leave: [What doesn't apply]

REFERENCE 2:
[Description or link]
What to take: [Specific element]
What to leave: [What doesn't apply]
```

### 5. Boundaries

What to avoid:

```
DESIGN BOUNDARIES:

DO NOT:
- [Anti-pattern 1]
- [Anti-pattern 2]
- [Anti-pattern 3]

AVOID RESEMBLANCE TO:
- [Competitor or style to differentiate from]

NEVER:
- [Absolute restrictions]
```

### Feedback Guidelines

```
GIVING DESIGN FEEDBACK:

4. Be specific about what's not (and why)
5. Frame as questions when uncertain
6. Provide references when helpful
7. Prioritize feedback (critical vs. nice-to-have)
