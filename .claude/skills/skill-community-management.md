## Core Philosophy

> "A community is not an audience you speak to. It's a tribe you belong to."

Community management is not customer service with emoji. It's:
- Creating belonging, not just engagement
- Empowering members to lead
- Establishing culture and rituals
- Building a moat through relationships
