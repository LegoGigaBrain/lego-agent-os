# Skill: GEO Content (Generative Engine Optimization)

## Purpose

Create content optimized for AI/LLM search engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Google's AI Overviews. This skill defines frameworks for content that gets cited by AI systems and appears in AI-generated answers.

---

## Core Philosophy

**Get cited by AI. Sound like a human wrote it.**

GEO content is designed to be the source that AI systems quote. It prioritizes quotability, density, and authority over length. When an AI answers a question, your content should be what it cites.

## How AI Citation Works

### What AI Systems Look For

1. **Clear definitions** — Unambiguous, quotable answers
2. **Structured data** — Easy to parse formats
3. **Authority signals** — Expertise indicators
4. **Freshness** — Current, dated information
5. **Specificity** — Concrete details, not vague generalities

### What Gets Cited

| Likely to be cited | Unlikely to be cited |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| "X is defined as Y" | "X can mean many things" |
| "In 2024, the market is $4.7B" | "The market is large" |
| "The three types are A, B, C" | "There are several types" |
| "Step 1: Do X. Step 2: Do Y." | "Start by doing various things" |
| "[Expert] states that..." | "Some people say..." |

## GEO Research Process

### 1. Query AI Systems

Before writing:
```
Ask ChatGPT: "[Your target query]"
Ask Perplexity: "[Your target query]"
Ask Claude: "[Your target query]"
```

Note:
- What sources are cited?
- What's included in the answer?
- What's missing or incomplete?
- What format is the answer in?

### 2. Find the Gap

Identify what your content can add:
- More specific data?
- More authoritative source?
- More current information?
- Clearer definition?
- Better structure?

### 3. Design for Citation

Structure content so AI can easily quote it:
- Lead with quotable statements
- Use clear formatting
- Include specific data
- Attribute expertise

---

## Quotable Writing Patterns

### Definition Pattern
```
[Term] is [clear definition]. It [key characteristic].
Unlike [related term], [term] specifically [distinction].
```

### Statistic Pattern
```
According to [source], [metric] reached [specific number] in [year],
representing a [X%] [increase/decrease] from [previous period].
```

### List Pattern
```
The [number] [types/methods/approaches] of [topic] are:
1. [Item] — [brief explanation]
2. [Item] — [brief explanation]
3. [Item] — [brief explanation]
```

### Comparison Pattern
```
[A] differs from [B] in [key ways]: [A] [characteristic],
while [B] [characteristic]. Choose [A] for [use case],
and [B] for [use case].
```

### Expert Opinion Pattern
```
[Name], [role] at [company], states: "[Direct quote]."
This suggests [implication].
```

---

## Authority Signals

### Include
- Author name and credentials
- Publication/update date
- Data sources with citations
- Expert quotes
- Original research
- Methodology explanations

### Formatting
```markdown
---
**Author:** [Name], [Title/Credentials]
**Last Updated:** [Date]
**Reviewed by:** [Expert name] (optional)
---
```

---

## Voice Guidelines

### Same Rules as SEO

**Kill:**
- "Delve"
- "Comprehensive"
- "Landscape"
- "In today's world"

**Add:**
- Specific numbers
- Real examples
- Personal opinions
- Honest limitations

### GEO-Specific Voice

**Prioritize:**
- Directness over hedging
- Specificity over generality
- Density over length
- Clarity over completeness

**Example transformation:**
```
Before: "There are many factors to consider when choosing a CRM,
and the best choice depends on various business needs and requirements."

After: "Choose HubSpot for marketing-first teams, Salesforce for
enterprise sales, or Pipedrive for SMB sales teams. The decision
comes down to: team size, budget, and primary use case."
```

## Measuring GEO Success

### Direct Indicators
- Cited in Perplexity answers (check sources)
- Cited in ChatGPT with browsing
- Appears in Google AI Overview
- Linked in Claude answers

### Indirect Indicators
- Referral traffic from AI platforms
- Brand mentions in AI contexts
- Increased "according to [brand]" searches

### Testing
Periodically ask AI systems your target queries and check:
- Are you cited?
- Is your content quoted accurately?
- What could make it more quotable?

## Anti-Patterns

1. **Being vague** — AI needs specifics to cite
2. **Burying the answer** — Lead with quotable content
3. **Wall of text** — AI parses structured content better
4. **No sources** — Cited data is more credible
5. **No attribution** — Author signals authority
6. **Outdated content** — Fresh content gets preferred
7. **Trying to rank AND get cited** — Different strategies, pick one per page

## SEO vs GEO: When to Use Which

| Factor | Use SEO | Use GEO |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Query type | Exploratory, browsing | Specific questions |
| User intent | Research, compare | Quick answer |
| Content length | Longer is often better | Concise is better |
| Competition | Compete on depth | Compete on quotability |
| Win condition | Page 1 ranking | AI citation |

**Hybrid approach:** Create pillar content (SEO) with quotable summary sections (GEO).
