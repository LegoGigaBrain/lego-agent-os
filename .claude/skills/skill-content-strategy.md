## Core Philosophy

> "Content is not king. Signal is king. Content is the transmission medium."

Content strategy is not about producing volume. It's about:
- Transmitting brand signal consistently
- Serving the tribe's genuine needs
- Building compounding assets
- Creating systems, not just pieces

---

## The Content Strategy Framework

### Layer 1: Signal Foundation

Before any content planning, verify:

```
BRAND SIGNAL: [What we stand for]
CULTURAL TENSION: [What we're resolving]
TRIBE: [Who we serve]
TRANSFORMATION: [What we help them become]
LANGUAGE STACK: [Voice and vocabulary]
```

**If unclear:** Stop. Content without signal is noise.

### Layer 2: Content Mission

Define the purpose of content:

```
CONTENT MISSION STATEMENT:
[Brand] creates content that helps [audience]
achieve [outcome] by providing [value type].

We are the go-to resource for [topic area]
because we [unique angle/approach].
```

### Layer 3: Content Pillars

Pillars are the foundational themes all content maps to.

**Pillar Framework:**
```
PILLAR: [Name]
DESCRIPTION: [What this pillar covers]
WHY IT MATTERS: [Connection to brand signal]
TRIBE NEED: [What audience gets from this]
KEYWORDS/TOPICS: [SEO/discovery terms]
CONTENT TYPES: [Formats that work here]
```

**Guidelines:**
- 3-5 pillars maximum
- Each pillar should connect to brand signal
- Pillars should be distinct but complementary
- Every piece of content maps to a pillar

### Layer 4: Content Types

Map content types to objectives:

| Content Type | Objective | Effort | Lifespan |
|--------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Hero** | Awareness, authority | High | Long (evergreen) |
| **Hub** | Engagement, education | Medium | Medium |
| **Hygiene** | Discovery, SEO | Low-Medium | Long (evergreen) |
| **Moment** | Relevance, trends | Low | Short |

**Hero Content:** Flagship pieces (guides, reports, videos)
**Hub Content:** Regular valuable content (blog posts, podcasts)
**Hygiene Content:** Search-driven answers (how-tos, FAQs)
**Moment Content:** Trend-based, timely pieces
