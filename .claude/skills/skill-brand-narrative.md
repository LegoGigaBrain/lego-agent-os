# Skill: Brand Narrative

## Purpose

Construct the foundational story architecture that transforms brand strategy into an uncopyable narrative moat. This skill synthesizes archetypes, positioning, and founder truth into a cohesive brand mythology that guides all storytelling.

## Standards Awareness

Before applying this skill, ensure familiarity with:
- `standards/signalos/brand-strategy.md`
- `standards/signalos/cultural-brands.md`
- `standards/signalos/tribe-building.md`

## Why Narrative Matters

Features get copied. Stories don't.

A brand narrative is not marketing copy — it's the **deep story structure** that:

1. **Creates meaning** — Transforms transactions into transformation
2. **Builds defensibility** — Your origin, journey, and mythology can't be replicated
3. **Unifies expression** — Provides the spine for all content, campaigns, and communications
4. **Generates content** — A rich narrative yields infinite stories
5. **Deepens loyalty** — People don't just buy products, they join stories

## Core Philosophy

### Narrative as Moat

Traditional moats are:
- Technology (gets copied)
- Network effects (can be outspent)
- Economies of scale (can be matched)

Narrative moat is:
- **Authenticity** — Your real story can't be fabricated by competitors
- **Time** — History compounds; newcomers can't manufacture legacy
- **Belief** — Earned conviction can't be bought
- **Culture** — Living mythology resists imitation

### The Story Hierarchy

```
                    ┌─────────────────┐
                    │   Brand Myth    │ ← Timeless, universal
                    │   (Archetype)   │
                    └────────┬────────┘
                             │
                    ┌────────▼────────┐
                    │  Origin Story   │ ← Foundational, fixed
                    │  (Why we exist) │
                    └────────┬────────┘
                             │
                    ┌────────▼────────┐
                    │ Brand Narrative │ ← Strategic, evolving

                    └────────┬────────┘
                             │

## Brand Narrative Components

### 1. Origin Story

The founding myth — the inciting incident that sparked the brand's existence.

**Elements:**
- **Inciting Incident** — What injustice, gap, or vision started this?
- **Founder's Struggle** — What obstacles were overcome?
- **Breakthrough Moment** — The turning point that made it real
- **Founding Belief** — The conviction that drove action

**Questions to Extract:**
- "What made you angry or frustrated enough to start this?"
- "What did you see that others didn't?"
- "When did you know this had to exist?"
- "What did you sacrifice to make this real?"

**Format:**
```
Before [Brand], [problem/injustice existed].
[Founder] saw [insight/vision].
After [struggle/journey], [breakthrough happened].
Now, [Brand] exists to [mission].
```

---

### 2. Brand Mythology

The recurring themes, symbols, and patterns that create a brand "universe."

**Elements:**

#### The Hero
Who is the hero of your brand story?
- **Brand as Hero** — Brand overcomes obstacles (Nike, Apple)
- **Customer as Hero** — Customer transforms; brand is guide (Peloton, Notion)
- **Shared Journey** — Brand and customer transform together (Patagonia)

#### The Enemy
What does the brand fight against?
- Not a competitor — an **antagonist force**
- A worldview, system, or behavior the brand opposes
- Must be something the tribe also opposes

**Examples:**
| Brand | Enemy |
|-------|-------|
| Apple | Conformity, complexity |
| Patagonia | Consumerism, environmental destruction |
| Tesla | Fossil fuel dependence |
| Harley | Suburban domestication |

#### The Quest
What is the brand's ongoing mission?
- The unfinished journey that keeps the story alive
- Big enough to never fully "win"
- Specific enough to guide action

#### Recurring Symbols
Visual and verbal motifs that reinforce the mythology:
- **Visual symbols** — Colors, shapes, imagery patterns
- **Verbal symbols** — Phrases, metaphors, named concepts
- **Rituals** — Repeated behaviors that embody the story

### 3. Narrative Moat

The story elements that create competitive defensibility.

**Authenticity Moat**
- Real history that can't be fabricated
- Genuine founder journey
- Earned credibility through action

**Questions:**
- "What have you done that proves your beliefs?"
- "What sacrifice demonstrates your commitment?"
- "What story can only you tell?"

**Time Moat**
- Historical moments that compound meaning
- Legacy decisions that shaped the brand
- Timeline of belief-in-action

**Questions:**
- "What key moments shaped who you are?"
- "What decisions do you point to as proof of values?"
- "What history would a newcomer have to manufacture?"

**Belief Moat**
- Convictions that attract true believers
- Polarizing stances that create loyalty
- Non-negotiables that define identity

**Questions:**
- "What will you never compromise on?"
- "What belief costs you customers — and you accept that?"
- "What would make your best customers leave?"

**Culture Moat**
- Living mythology within the organization
- Stories told internally that reinforce identity
- Tribal knowledge that can't be documented

**Questions:**
- "What stories do employees tell about 'how things work here'?"
- "What do people learn in their first month that isn't in any handbook?"
- "What makes someone 'get' your culture?"

### 4. Story Principles

Guidelines for how to tell stories in this brand.

## Narrative Development Process

### Step 1: Gather Inputs

Before developing narrative, ensure you have:

| Input | Source |
|-------|--------|
| Founder discovery | `/brand-strategy` SYNC phase |
| Archetype profile | `/archetype-analysis` |
| Positioning | `/brand-positioning` |
| Tribe definition | `/brand-strategy` I AM + POV |

### Step 2: Extract Origin Story

1. Review founder discovery for inciting incident
2. Identify the core struggle/obstacle
3. Find the breakthrough moment
4. Articulate the founding belief
5. Craft the origin narrative

### Step 3: Build Brand Mythology

1. **Determine the hero model**
   - Review archetype — some archetypes are naturally hero-brands (Hero, Outlaw)
   - Review tribe — are they seeking transformation or belonging?
   - Decide: Brand as hero, customer as hero, or shared journey

2. **Define the enemy**
   - Review cultural tension from positioning
   - Identify the antagonist force (not competitor)
   - Ensure tribe shares this enemy

3. **Articulate the quest**
   - Review mission and vision
   - Frame as ongoing journey
   - Make it big enough to never "complete"

4. **Identify recurring symbols**
   - Visual: colors, shapes, imagery
   - Verbal: metaphors, named concepts
   - Ritualistic: repeated behaviors

### Step 4: Document Narrative Moat

1. **Authenticity elements**
   - What's genuinely yours?
   - What proves your beliefs?

2. **Time elements**
   - Key historical moments
   - Legacy decisions

3. **Belief elements**
   - Non-negotiables
   - Polarizing stances

4. **Culture elements**
   - Internal mythology
   - Tribal knowledge

### Step 5: Define Story Principles

1. Establish narrative voice
2. Define story types the brand tells
3. Set story boundaries
4. Create storytelling guidelines
