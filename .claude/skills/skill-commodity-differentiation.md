# Skill: Commodity Differentiation

## Purpose

Apply the 8 Commodity Traits to escape commodity competition. This skill helps brands wrap products in something bigger than the product itself, creating differentiation that transcends features.

## Standards Awareness

Before applying this skill, ensure familiarity with:
- `standards/signalos/commodity-traits.md`
- `standards/signalos/brand-strategy.md`

## Core Principle

You don't need a better product. You need something bigger than the product.

In a world of commoditization, product features alone cannot create differentiation. The brands that win are those that wrap their products in a trait that transcends the functional.

---

## The 8 Commodity Traits

| Trait | Principle |
|-------|-----------|
| Story | When the background story is bigger than the product |
| Belief | When values are bigger than the product |
| Cause | When purpose is bigger than the product |
| Heritage | When a sense of location is bigger than the product |
| Delight | When small surprises are bigger than the product |
| Transparency | When trust is bigger than the product |
| Solidarity | When belonging is bigger than the product |
| Individuality | When customization is bigger than the product |

## Trait Assessment Process

### Step 1: Audit Current State

For each trait, rate 1-5:
- 1 = Not present
- 3 = Somewhat present
- 5 = Strongly present and activated

| Trait | Score | Evidence |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Story | /5 | |
| Belief | /5 | |
| Cause | /5 | |
| Heritage | /5 | |
| Delight | /5 | |
| Transparency | /5 | |
| Solidarity | /5 | |
| Individuality | /5 | |

### Step 2: Identify Natural Strengths

**Questions:**
- Which traits already exist in your founding story?
- Which feel most authentic to who you are?
- Which resonate with your team?
- Which align with your customer's values?

### Step 3: Assess Competitive Landscape

**Questions:**
- Which traits do competitors own?
- Where is there white space?
- Which trait would most differentiate you?
- Which can you authentically claim?

### Step 4: Select 1-3 Primary Traits

**Rule:** Depth > breadth initially. Master one before adding another.
