# Skill: Verbal Identity

## Purpose

Design comprehensive verbal identity systems including voice, tone, vocabulary, and messaging architecture. This skill creates the language operating system that ensures consistent brand expression across all touchpoints.

## Standards Awareness

Before applying this skill, ensure familiarity with:
- `standards/signalos/transmission-framework.md`
- `standards/signalos/brand-strategy.md`

---

## Core Philosophy

> "Words are the frequency through which brand signal is transmitted. Get the words wrong, the signal distorts."

Verbal identity is not just a style guide. It's:
- The codified expression of brand signal
- A generative system for infinite content
- The bridge between strategy and execution
- What makes the brand recognizable even without visuals

---

## Verbal Identity Components

### 1. Brand Voice

The consistent personality that shows up in all communication.

```
VOICE DEFINITION:

CORE VOICE:
[3-5 word description of the fundamental voice]
Example: "Confident, warm, direct"

VOICE ATTRIBUTES:
- [Attribute 1]: [What it means + example]
- [Attribute 2]: [What it means + example]
- [Attribute 3]: [What it means + example]

VOICE SPECTRUM:
We are: [This] ←→ Not: [That]
We are: [This] ←→ Not: [That]
We are: [This] ←→ Not: [That]
```

### 2. Tone Matrix

How voice adapts to different contexts.

```
TONE MATRIX:

CONTEXT: [Situation]
Tone shift: [How voice adapts]
Example: [Sample copy]

CONTEXT: Celebratory
Tone shift: More energetic, warmer
Example: "You did it! Welcome to the [tribe]."

CONTEXT: Educational
Tone shift: Clearer, more patient
Example: "Here's how it works, step by step."

CONTEXT: Supportive
Tone shift: Warmer, more empathetic
Example: "We've got you. Let's figure this out together."

CONTEXT: Urgent
Tone shift: More direct, action-focused
Example: "This matters. Here's what to do now."

CONTEXT: Playful
Tone shift: Lighter, more personality
Example: "Ready to [fun action verb]? Let's go."
```

### 3. Language Stack

The hierarchy of brand language.

```
LANGUAGE STACK:

TAGLINE:
[5-7 words - compressed brand signal]
Purpose: Instant recognition, positioning summary
Usage: Hero moments, primary brand expression

POSITIONING LINE:
[Single sentence - what we do and why it matters]
Purpose: Clarify offering and value
Usage: Website, pitch, introductions

ELEVATOR PITCH:
[30-second spoken version]
Purpose: Verbal explanation
Usage: Networking, sales, interviews

BOILERPLATE:
[Standard written description - 50-100 words]
Purpose: Press, bios, formal contexts
Usage: PR, about pages, official documents

TRANSMISSION LINES:
[Recurring phrases that reinforce signal]
Purpose: Recognizable expressions
Usage: Repeated across touchpoints
Examples:
- "[Phrase 1]"
- "[Phrase 2]"
- "[Phrase 3]"
```

### 4. Lexicon

The vocabulary that belongs to the brand.

```
LEXICON:

CORE TERMS:
Terms central to the brand's world

| Term | Definition | Usage |
|------|------------|-------|
| [Term] | [What it means] | [Where/how used] |

PREFERRED LANGUAGE:
Words we favor over alternatives

| Say This | Not This | Why |
|----------|----------|-----|
| [Preferred] | [Avoided] | [Rationale] |

FORBIDDEN WORDS:
Terms we never use

| Word | Why We Avoid |
|------|--------------|
| [Term] | [Rationale] |

FORBIDDEN PUNCTUATION:
| Character | Why We Avoid |
|-----------|--------------|
| — (em dash) | AI writing signal. Use commas, colons, parentheses, or periods instead. |

INSIDER LANGUAGE:
Terms our tribe uses/recognizes

| Term | Meaning | Origin |
|------|---------|--------|
| [Term] | [Meaning] | [Where it came from] |
```

### 5. Messaging Architecture

Structured messages for key topics.

```
MESSAGING ARCHITECTURE:

TOPIC: [Key message area]

PRIMARY MESSAGE:
[One sentence - the main thing to say]

SUPPORTING MESSAGES:
1. [Support point with proof]
2. [Support point with proof]
3. [Support point with proof]

PROOF POINTS:
- [Evidence/statistic/testimonial]
- [Evidence/statistic/testimonial]

OBJECTION HANDLING:
Objection: [Common pushback]
Response: [How we address it]
```

---

## Voice Development Process

### Step 1: Extract from Brand Strategy

Pull from existing brand work:
- Archetype (personality foundation)
- Values (behavioral guide)
- Tribe (who we're speaking to)
- Cultural tension (what we stand for/against)

### Step 2: Define Voice Attributes

```
ATTRIBUTE DEVELOPMENT:

For each attribute:
1. Name the attribute
2. Define what it means for us
3. Show how it manifests in copy
4. Contrast with what it's NOT
5. Provide multiple examples

ATTRIBUTE: [Name]

DEFINITION:
[What this means for our brand voice]

IN PRACTICE:
[How this shows up in actual writing]

THIS, NOT THAT:
This: [Example of the attribute done right]
Not: [Example of what to avoid]

EXAMPLES:
- [Example 1]
- [Example 2]
- [Example 3]
```

### Step 3: Create Tone Variations

Map how voice adapts:

| Context | Energy | Warmth | Formality | Example |
|---------|--------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Welcome | High | High | Low | "Hey! So glad you're here." |
| Error | Medium | High | Low | "Oops, something went wrong. Let's fix it." |
| Success | High | High | Low | "You did it! That's huge." |
| Instruction | Medium | Medium | Medium | "Here's what to do next." |
| Serious | Low | Medium | High | "We need to address something important." |

### Step 4: Build the Lexicon

```
LEXICON DEVELOPMENT:

1. AUDIT EXISTING LANGUAGE
   - What terms are we already using?
   - What inconsistencies exist?

2. DEFINE CORE VOCABULARY
   - What are our key concepts?
   - What do we call things?

3. SET PREFERENCES
   - What words feel like us?
   - What words feel off-brand?

4. IDENTIFY FORBIDDEN TERMS
   - What do competitors say?
   - What's generic or clichéd?

5. CREATE INSIDER LANGUAGE
   - What can only we say?
   - What builds tribe identity?
```
