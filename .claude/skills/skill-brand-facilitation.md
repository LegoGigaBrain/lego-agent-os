# Skill: Brand Facilitation

## Purpose

Guide founders through structured brand discovery interviews to uncover their brand foundations. This skill defines the methodology for facilitating conversations that surface origin stories, purpose, positioning, customer design, and brand commitment - resulting in a comprehensive brand discovery brief.

## Standards Awareness

Before applying this skill, ensure familiarity with:
- `standards/signalos/brand-strategy.md`
- `.claude/skills/skill-brand-flip.md`
- `.claude/skills/skill-onliness-statement.md`

## Discovery Philosophy

### Interview, Don't Prescribe

The facilitator's role is to **ask and document**, not to decide or execute. Great brand facilitation:
- Draws out what already exists within the founder
- Creates space for honest reflection
- Captures authentic voice and conviction
- Identifies gaps without filling them prematurely

### Core Principle

**"The brand already exists in the founder's mind. Our job is to help them articulate it."**

## The 6 Discovery Phases

### Phase 1: Origin & Context

**Purpose:** Understand the founder's journey and what led them here.

**Questions:**
- What led you to starting this business?
- How did it all come about?
- What were some defining moments and beliefs driving this decision?
- What problem are you solving?
- How does this problem make your customers feel?
- What industry or category are you entering?
- Who is your "Goliath" (main competitor or status quo you're fighting)?

**Capture:**
- Origin story narrative
- Founding beliefs and motivations
- Problem statement
- Competitive landscape awareness

---

### Phase 2: Positioning

**Purpose:** Define where the brand sits in the market and minds of customers.

**Questions:**
- Who is your audience (community)?
- What category do you compete in?
- What functional, symbolic, or experiential benefits do you provide?
- What are your reasons to believe (support)?
- How are you different from alternatives?
- What trends can you position yourself to catch for momentum?

**Capture:**

### Phase 3: Purpose (VPVMG)

**Purpose:** Establish the foundational values, purpose, vision, mission, and goals.

**Values Questions:**
- Who are you?
- Where does your passion lie?
- What gets you up in the morning?
- What are some values and beliefs you cherish most in life?
- How do these show up in whatever business you run?

**Purpose Questions:**
- What is the reason for this business's existence beyond making money?
- Who do you serve and why them particularly?
- What responsibility are you mandated to fulfill in this industry?
- Why is this important? Why does it matter?

**Vision Questions:**
- What do you see being said about your company 25 years from now?
- With absolutely no limitations, what impact would your brand have made on the world?
- How would it impact people's lives - those who work with you and those who buy from you?
- How big would the company have grown? Let your imagination run wild.

**Mission Questions:**
- How are you going to live out this purpose?
- What actions and commitments make the purpose real?

### Phase 4: Customer Design

**Purpose:** Define who customers BECOME through engaging with the brand, not just who they are.

**Current State Questions:**
- Who loves your products or services?
- Which men or women specifically?
- Where are they?
- What are their goals?
- What tribe are they looking to plug into?

**Transformation Questions:**
- More important than demographics: who do they want to become?
- What does your product symbolize to them?
- How can your brand help build your customers' identities?
- What would be their answer to: "If I buy this product, what does that say/make of me?"
- What is the highest good you could do for people who engage with your service?
- How will you back it up or enforce that good?

**Brand Commitment Questions:**
- What will customers get from joining the tribe?
- What will investors, partners, and suppliers get?

**Capture:**
- Customer profile (demographics + psychographics)
- Customer transformation statement
- Identity contribution articulation
- Tribe value proposition

---

### Phase 5: Onliness Statement

**Purpose:** Articulate what makes the brand the ONLY one in its category.

**Questions:**
- What category will you attempt to lead?
- What is your category specifically?
- How are you different?
- Who are your customers?
- Where are they located?
- When do they need you?
- Why are you important?

**Synthesis Exercise:**
Complete this statement:
> Our [brand] is the only [category] that [onliness/unique difference].

**Capture:**
- Category definition
- Differentiation factors
- Complete onliness statement

---

### Phase 6: Brand Commitment Matrix

**Purpose:** Align customer needs with company offerings using the I AM + POV framework.

**Customer (I AM) Questions:**
- **Identity:** Who are they / who do they want to become?
- **Aims:** What do they want from you?
- **Mores:** How do they belong? What behaviors define their tribe?

**Company (POV) Questions:**
- **Purpose:** Why do we exist? (Should align with customer identity)
- **Onliness:** What do we uniquely offer? (Should serve customer aims)
- **Values:** How do we behave? (Should sync with customer mores)

**Alignment Check:**
- Does our purpose help them become who they want to be?
- Does our onliness serve their goals?
- Are our values in sync with their tribal behaviors?

**Capture:**
- Complete Brand Commitment Matrix
- Alignment assessment
- Gap identification

## Handoff Recommendations

Based on discovery outcomes, recommend handoffs to:

| Discovery Outcome | Recommended Handoff | Agent |
|-------------------|---------------------|-------|
| Brand foundations complete | Full brand strategy development | @brand-strategist |
| Verbal identity needs development | Voice, tone, messaging architecture | @verbal-identity-designer |
| Visual identity needed | Visual direction and design system | @visual-designer |
| Market positioning unclear | Competitive analysis and research | @research-analyst |
| Customer design needs depth | Customer research and interviews | @user-researcher |
| Product not yet defined | Product discovery first | @ideation-facilitator |

### Handoff Decision Tree

```
Is brand discovery complete?
├── Yes, all 6 phases covered
│   ├── Ready for brand strategy → @brand-strategist
│   └── Ready for verbal identity → @verbal-identity-designer
├── Partial, but product unclear
│   └── Needs product discovery first → @ideation-facilitator
├── Partial, customer unclear
│   └── Needs customer research → @user-researcher
└── Partial, market unclear
    └── Needs market research → @research-analyst
```

## Session Best Practices

### Opening the Session
1. Explain the purpose: "We're going to uncover your brand foundations through conversation"
2. Set expectations: "I'll ask questions and capture your answers - there are no wrong answers"
3. Confirm time: "This typically takes 60-90 minutes across all phases"

### During the Session
- Use follow-up questions to go deeper ("Tell me more about that", "Why does that matter?")
- Capture exact language - founder's words often become brand copy
- Note energy shifts - what excites them reveals priorities
- Don't correct or optimize during discovery - just capture

### Closing the Session
1. Summarize key discoveries
2. Identify gaps that need more exploration
3. Explain what comes next (brief delivery, handoffs)
4. Thank them for their vulnerability and openness
