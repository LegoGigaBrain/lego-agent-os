# Skill: Growth Loops

## Purpose

Design sustainable, self-reinforcing growth systems that compound over time. This skill shifts focus from linear campaign thinking to loop-based growth architecture.

## Standards Awareness

## Core Philosophy

> "Campaigns end. Loops compound."

Growth loops are closed systems where the output of one cycle becomes the input for the next. Unlike linear funnels (spend → acquire → hope), loops create sustainable growth engines.

**Linear Thinking:** Spend $100 → Get 10 users → Spend another $100
**Loop Thinking:** User experiences value → User shares → New user joins → New user experiences value → Repeat

---

## Types of Growth Loops

### 1. Viral Loops

**Mechanism:** Users bring in more users through sharing or invitation

**Structure:**
```
User experiences value
    → User shares/invites
        → New user joins
            → New user experiences value
                → Repeat
```

**Examples:**
- Dropbox: Extra storage for referrals
- PayPal: Cash bonus for invites
- Notion: Better with teammates

**Key Metrics:**
- Viral coefficient (K-factor)
- Cycle time
- Invitation acceptance rate

### 2. Content Loops

**Mechanism:** Content attracts audience, audience creates/shares content

**Structure:**
```
Create valuable content
    → Audience discovers via search/social
        → Audience engages and shares
            → More people discover
                → Some create their own content
                    → Repeat
```

**Examples:**
- HubSpot: Free resources → SEO traffic → Lead capture
- YouTube creators: Videos → Subscribers → More videos
- Product Hunt: Launches → Traffic → More launches

**Key Metrics:**
- Content velocity
- Organic traffic growth
- User-generated content rate

### 3. Paid Loops

**Mechanism:** Revenue funds acquisition, acquisition generates revenue

**Structure:**
```
Ad spend
    → Customer acquisition
        → Revenue/LTV
            → Reinvest in ad spend
                → Repeat
```

**Requirements:**
- LTV > CAC (with margin)
- Predictable conversion rates
- Scalable channels

**Key Metrics:**
- CAC payback period
- LTV:CAC ratio
- ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)

### 4. Community Loops

**Mechanism:** Community creates value, value attracts new members

**Structure:**
```
Value provided to community
    → Community engagement
        → Members help each other
            → Word of mouth spreads
                → New members join
                    → More value created
                        → Repeat
```

**Examples:**
- Stack Overflow: Answers → SEO → More users → More answers
- Reddit: Content → Engagement → Growth → More content
- Discord communities: Activity → Culture → Attraction

**Key Metrics:**
- Community engagement rate
- Member-to-member ratio
- Organic join rate

### 5. Product Loops

**Mechanism:** Product usage naturally exposes product to new users

**Structure:**
```
User uses product
    → Usage creates exposure
        → Non-user sees product
            → Non-user becomes user
                → Repeat
```

**Examples:**
- Calendly: Meeting links expose product
- Loom: Video links showcase product
- Figma: Collaboration exposes product

**Key Metrics:**
- Exposure per user
- Exposure-to-signup rate
- Time to value for new users

### 6. Data/Network Loops

**Mechanism:** More users create more data/connections, making product more valuable

**Structure:**
```
Users join platform
    → Create data/connections
        → Product improves
            → More valuable to users
                → Attracts more users
                    → Repeat
```

**Examples:**
- Waze: More drivers → Better data → Better product
- LinkedIn: More connections → More value → More users
- Marketplace platforms: More supply/demand → Better matching

**Key Metrics:**
- Network density
- Data accumulation rate
- Value per user over time

## Designing Growth Loops

### Step 1: Identify Loop Potential

**Questions:**
- What value does your product create?
- How is that value shared or exposed?
- What natural sharing behavior exists?
- Where does usage create visibility?

**Value Exposure Audit:**
```
PRODUCT VALUE: [What users get]
NATURAL EXPOSURE: [How others see it]
SHARING INCENTIVE: [Why they'd share]
JOIN INCENTIVE: [Why others would join]
```

### Step 2: Map the Loop

**Loop Mapping Template:**
```
LOOP NAME: [Descriptive name]
LOOP TYPE: [Viral/Content/Paid/Community/Product/Data]

STAGES:
1. TRIGGER: [What initiates the loop]
2. ACTION: [What the user does]
3. REWARD: [What the user gets]
4. EXPOSURE: [How new users discover]
5. CONVERSION: [How exposure becomes user]

CYCLE TIME: [How long one loop takes]
```

### Step 3: Identify Friction Points

At each stage, ask:
- What could stop users here?
- What makes this step hard?
- What reduces motivation?
- What creates confusion?

**Friction Reduction Framework:**
```
STAGE: [Loop stage]
FRICTION: [What slows/stops users]
REDUCTION: [How to remove friction]
METRIC: [How to measure improvement]
```

### Step 4: Design Amplifiers

**Amplifier Types:**

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Incentive | Reward for loop participation | Referral bonuses |
| Social | Make sharing feel good | Share achievements |
| Utility | Make sharing useful | Share to collaborate |
| Content | Provide shareable assets | Templates, tools |
| Status | Confer status for participation | Badges, recognition |

### Step 5: Set Metrics & Targets

**Core Loop Metrics:**

| Metric | Definition | Target Benchmark |
|--------|------------|------------------|
| K-factor | Invites sent × Conversion rate | >1 for viral growth |
| Cycle time | Time for one complete loop | Shorter = faster growth |
| Loop efficiency | % of users who complete loop | Higher = healthier loop |
| Loop retention | % who complete multiple loops | Sustainability indicator |

## Loop Analysis Framework

### The AARRR → Loop Translation

**Traditional Funnel (AARRR):**
Acquisition → Activation → Retention → Revenue → Referral

**Loop Reframe:**
```
Instead of linear stages, identify:
- Where does Referral feed back to Acquisition?
- Where does Retention create more value?
- Where does Revenue enable reinvestment?
```

### Loop Health Assessment

**Healthy Loop Signs:**
- Cycle time decreasing
- K-factor stable or growing
- Loop completion rate stable
- Multiple loops per user

**Unhealthy Loop Signs:**
- Cycle time increasing
- K-factor declining
- Completion rate dropping
- One-and-done behavior

### Loop Stacking

**Principle:** The best growth systems combine multiple loops

**Example Stack:**
```
PRIMARY LOOP: Product Loop (Calendly-style exposure)
    feeds into →
SECONDARY LOOP: Content Loop (user success stories)
    feeds into →
TERTIARY LOOP: Community Loop (user community)
```

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: No Natural Loop

**Problem:** Forcing sharing behavior that doesn't naturally exist
**Solution:** Find where value is already being shared, amplify that

### Mistake 2: Weak Value Moment

**Problem:** Prompting share before user experiences value
**Solution:** Map value moments, trigger share after (not before)

### Mistake 3: High Friction

**Problem:** Too many steps to complete loop
**Solution:** Reduce steps, one-click actions, pre-fill data

### Mistake 4: Misaligned Incentives

**Problem:** Rewarding quantity over quality (spam referrals)
**Solution:** Reward for value, not just volume

### Mistake 5: Single Loop Dependency

**Problem:** Entire growth depends on one loop
**Solution:** Stack multiple loops, diversify growth engines

### Mistake 6: Ignoring Cycle Time

**Problem:** Loop takes too long to complete
**Solution:** Find ways to shorten cycle, parallel loops
