## Core Philosophy

> "Copy is salesmanship in print. Every word must earn its place by moving the reader closer to action."

Copywriting is not creative writing. It's:
- Strategic communication with a goal
- Persuasion through clarity
- Brand voice in action
- The bridge between attention and conversion

## The Copywriting Framework

### Before You Write

```
COPY BRIEF CHECK:

1. OBJECTIVE:
   What action do we want? [Click/Buy/Sign up/Read more]

2. AUDIENCE:
   Who is reading this? [Specific persona]
   Where are they in the journey? [Awareness/Consideration/Decision]

3. MESSAGE:
   What's the single most important thing to say?
   What proof supports it?

4. VOICE:
   What's the brand voice?
   What tone for this context?

5. CONSTRAINTS:
   Word/character limits?
   Format requirements?
   Compliance/legal needs?
```

### The AIDA Framework

Classic structure for persuasive copy:

```
A - ATTENTION
Hook them immediately
[Headline, subject line, first sentence]

I - INTEREST
Build curiosity and relevance
[Why this matters to them]

D - DESIRE
Create want through benefits
[What they get, how life improves]

A - ACTION
Tell them exactly what to do
[Clear, specific CTA]
```

### The PAS Framework

Problem-focused approach:

```
P - PROBLEM
Articulate their pain
[Show you understand their struggle]

A - AGITATE
Make the problem vivid
[Consequences of not solving]

S - SOLUTION
Present your answer
[How you solve it + CTA]
```

### The 4 Cs

Quality checklist for all copy:

```
CLEAR
- No jargon or confusion
- One idea per sentence
- Reader knows what you mean

CONCISE
- No wasted words
- Every word earns its place
- Shortest way to say it

COMPELLING
- Benefits, not just features
- Emotional connection
- Reason to care

- Authentic to brand
- No over-promising
```

## Copy Types

### Headlines

The most important line. Must stop the scroll.

```
HEADLINE FORMULAS:

HOW-TO:
"How to [Achieve Desired Outcome] in [Timeframe]"
Example: "How to Double Your Leads in 30 Days"

QUESTION:
"[Question That Triggers Curiosity]?"
Example: "What If Your Marketing Actually Worked?"

NUMBER:
"[Number] Ways to [Achieve Outcome]"
Example: "7 Secrets Top Brands Use to Stand Out"

COMMAND:
"[Action Verb] Your [Desired Outcome]"
Example: "Transform Your Brand in One Week"

CHALLENGE:
"Stop [Doing X], Start [Doing Y]"
Example: "Stop Guessing, Start Growing"

OUTCOME:
"[The Outcome They Want]"
Example: "A Brand People Actually Remember"
```

**Headline Quality Check:**
- [ ] Specific (not vague)
- [ ] Benefit-focused
- [ ] Curiosity-creating
- [ ] Brand voice aligned

### Body Copy

The substance that sells.

```
BODY COPY PRINCIPLES:

1. LEAD WITH BENEFIT
   First sentence should answer "what's in it for me?"

2. ONE IDEA PER PARAGRAPH
   Keep it scannable

3. USE "YOU" LIBERALLY
   Make it about the reader

4. BREAK UP TEXT
   Short paragraphs, bullets, subheads

5. BUILD TO CTA
   Every paragraph moves toward action

STRUCTURE:
- Hook (expand on headline promise)
- Problem (show you understand)
- Solution (what you offer)
- Proof (why to believe)
- CTA (what to do next)
```

### CTAs (Calls to Action)

Where copy converts.

```
CTA FORMULA:
[Action Verb] + [Value/Outcome]

EXAMPLES:
- "Get Your Free Guide" (not "Submit")
- "Start Growing Today" (not "Sign Up")
- "See How It Works" (not "Learn More")
- "Join 10,000+ Marketers" (with social proof)

CTA PRINCIPLES:
- Specific verb (Get, Start, Join, Discover)
- Value-focused (what they get)
- Low friction (easy next step)
- Urgency when appropriate (Now, Today)

CTA HIERARCHY:
- Primary: Main action we want
- Secondary: Alternative for not-ready
- Tertiary: Soft engagement (learn more)
```

## Writing Techniques

### Power Words

Words that trigger response:

```

"Fast results"

### Voice & Tone Application

```
VOICE IN COPY:

If voice is CONFIDENT:
- "Here's exactly what you need."
- Use declarative statements
- Avoid hedging words (maybe, perhaps)

If voice is WARM:
- "We've got your back."
- Use inclusive language (we, together)
- Acknowledge feelings

If voice is PLAYFUL:
- "Ready to shake things up?"
- Use wordplay and wit
- Shorter, punchier sentences

If voice is AUTHORITATIVE:
- "Based on our research..."
- Cite evidence and data
- Expert positioning
