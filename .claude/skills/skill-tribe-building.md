# Skill: Tribe Building

## Purpose

Build, organize, and empower customer tribes instead of targeting market segments. This skill operationalizes the shift from demographic segmentation to identity-based community building.

## Standards Awareness

Before applying this skill, ensure familiarity with:
- `standards/signalos/tribe-building.md`
- `standards/signalos/brand-strategy.md`

## Core Principle

**Segmentation:** Divide and conquer
**Tribe Building:** Multiply and conquer

A tribe is any group of people who share not only interests, but information. They talk to each other. They identify with their tribe.

---

## The Tribe Building Process

### Phase 1: Define the Tribe

#### Step 1: Identify Core Identity

**Questions:**
- Who are the people most likely to love what we offer?
- What identity do they aspire to?
- How do they describe themselves?

**Identity Statements:**
Tribe members identify as:
- "I am a [identity]"
- "I am an [brand] person"
- "I am part of the [tribe name]"

**Examples:**
- "I am a Mac person"
- "I am a Harley rider"
- "I am a CrossFitter"
- "I am a sneakerhead"

#### Step 2: Define Transformation

**The Core Question:** "Who do you want your customers to become?"

**Transformation Framework:**
```
We help [current state] become [transformed state]
by providing [mechanism].
```

**Examples:**
| Brand | Transformation |
|-------|----------------|
| Google | Make people smarter |
| Nike | Make people more athletic |
| Apple | Make people more creative |
| Peloton | Make people healthier and more disciplined |

#### Step 3: Map Tribal Mores

**Mores:** The unwritten rules that govern tribe behavior

**Questions:**
- What behaviors are celebrated?
- What behaviors are rejected?
- What signals membership?
- What language do insiders use?
- What rituals bind the tribe?

**Mores Template:**
```
IN THIS TRIBE:
- We value: [list values]
- We do: [celebrated behaviors]
- We don't: [rejected behaviors]
- We say: [insider language]
- We recognize: [membership signals]
```

### Phase 2: Design Belonging Mechanisms

#### Belonging Ladder

| Level | State | Design Questions |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| 1. Awareness | They know you exist | How do they discover us? |
| 2. Interest | They engage with content | What content draws them in? |
| 3. Consideration | They explore joining | What do they evaluate? |
| 4. Enrollment | They commit | How do they join? |
| 5. Engagement | They participate | How do they contribute? |
| 6. Advocacy | They recruit others | How do they spread the word? |
| 7. Leadership | They co-lead | What roles can they play? |

#### For Each Level, Design:

1. **Entry point** — How do they enter this level?
2. **Experience** — What do they experience here?
3. **Value exchange** — What do they give/get?
4. **Advancement** — How do they move to the next level?
5. **Signals** — How do others know they're at this level?

---

### Phase 3: Create Tribal Artifacts

#### Symbols

**Primary Symbol:** The main identifier (logo, mark)
**Secondary Symbols:** Supporting visual identifiers
**Insider Symbols:** Things only tribe members recognize

#### Language

**Vocabulary:**
- Terms tribe members use
- Names for things
- Insider shorthand

**Phrases:**
- Greeting/acknowledgment
- Values statements
- Battle cries

#### Rituals

**Regular Rituals:**
- Daily practices
- Weekly gatherings
- Monthly events
- Annual celebrations

**Transition Rituals:**
- Joining rituals
- Advancement rituals
- Celebration rituals

---

### Phase 4: Build Growth Loops

#### The Multiplication Framework

Instead of trying to reach everyone, focus on:
1. Finding true fans (smallest viable tribe)
2. Enabling them to recruit like-minded others
3. Supporting organic growth

#### Growth Loop Template

```
1. TRIGGER: What causes someone to share?
2. ACTION: What do they do to share?
3. REWARD: What does the sharer get?
4. EXPANSION: How does this bring in new members?
```

#### Key Questions

- "What does sharing this brand say about me?"
- "Do I believe in the values of this company?"
- "Would I be proud to associate with this tribe?"

---

### Phase 5: Empower Leadership

#### Brand Commitment Scale (BCS)

| Level | State | Goal |
|-------|-------|------|
| 1 | Satisfaction | Content |
| 2 | Delight | Impressed |
| 3 | Engagement | Enrolled |
| 4 | Empowerment | Co-leading |

**Goal:** Move as many customers as possible to Level 4

#### Level 4 Characteristics

Empowered customers:
- Incorporate brand into deepest parts of their lives
- Depend on it for emotional support, status, growth
- Move heaven and earth to ensure brand success
- Attract others with magnetic commitment

#### Leadership Roles

| Role | Description | Value to Tribe |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| Evangelist | Spreads the word | Growth |
| Expert | Shares knowledge | Education |
| Moderator | Facilitates discussion | Community health |
| Creator | Makes content | Engagement |
| Mentor | Guides newcomers | Onboarding |
| Ambassador | Represents externally | Credibility |

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Targeting Everyone

**Problem:** "Our target audience is everyone who..."
**Solution:** Find the truest fans, not the biggest market

### Mistake 2: Top-Down Control

**Problem:** Trying to control all communication
**Solution:** Provide frame, let tribe tell their own stories

### Mistake 3: Transactions Over Relationships

**Problem:** Focusing on sales over belonging
**Solution:** Design for long-term commitment, not just conversion

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Mores

**Problem:** Violating tribal rules for short-term gain
**Solution:** Know and respect the unwritten rules

### Mistake 5: No Path to Leadership

**Problem:** Nowhere for committed members to go
**Solution:** Design roles and advancement for true fans
