# Skill: Onliness Statement

## Purpose

Create powerful onliness statements that articulate radical differentiation. The onliness statement is the true test of whether a brand has achieved a ZAG — if you can't say you're the "only," you don't have a differentiation worth fighting for.

## Standards Awareness

Before applying this skill, ensure familiarity with:
- `standards/signalos/brand-strategy.md`
- `.claude/skills/skill-zag-positioning.md`

## The Onliness Framework

### Basic Template

```
Our brand is the ONLY [category] that [differentiator].
```

**First blank:** The category you compete in
**Second blank:** Your unique differentiation

### Rules

1. **Keep it brief** — If you can't keep it short, you don't have a ZAG
2. **Use the word "only"** — If you can't use "only," you don't have a ZAG
3. **Make it defensible** — Competitors shouldn't be able to make the same claim
4. **Aim for radical, not incremental** — Better is not a strategy; different is

## Extended Onliness Framework

The detailed version helps pinpoint the full differentiation:

| Element | Question | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| What | What is your category? | Defines the competitive frame |
| How | How are you different? | States the differentiation |
| Who | Who are your customers? | Segments the audience |
| Where | Where are they located? | Narrows market geography |
| When | When do they need you? | Focuses on a need state |
| Why | Why are you important? | Defines the underlying trend |

### Extended Template

```
[Brand] is the ONLY [category]
that [differentiator]
for [customer segment]
in [geographic/market scope]
during [need state/moment]
because [underlying trend/importance].
```

## Process

### Step 1: List Competitors' Claims

Make a list of all the competitors who could make the same claim as you. This exposes:
- Where you overlap (no differentiation)
- Where they're strong (their territory)
- Where there's white space (your opportunity)

### Step 2: Draft Basic Statement

Fill in the basic template:
- **Category:** What competitive category are you in?
- **Differentiator:** What makes you unique?

### Step 3: Test the "Only"

Ask:
- Can any competitor truthfully make this same claim?
- Would customers believe we're the "only"?
- Is this differentiation meaningful to them?

If yes to the first question, go back and sharpen.

### Step 4: Expand to Full Framework

Add the who, where, when, why elements to create a complete positioning foundation.

### Step 5: Check for Vampires

**Watch out for "ands" and commas** — they drain away difference.

**Bad:** "We're the only coffee shop that has great coffee AND friendly service AND convenient locations."

**Good:** "We're the only coffee shop that roasts beans on-site daily."

## Examples

### Strong Onliness Statements

| Brand | Category | Differentiator |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Harley-Davidson | Motorcycle | Makes big, loud motorcycles for macho guys |
| Mini | Compact car | Lets you be a fuel-conscious rebel |
| Apple | Personal computer | Designs the whole experience (hardware + software + services) |
| Patagonia | Outdoor apparel | Tells you NOT to buy if you don't need it |

### Extended Examples

**Volvo:**
```
Volvo is the ONLY car manufacturer
that prioritizes safety above all else
for families
globally
when they're choosing their primary vehicle
because growing safety consciousness drives purchase decisions.
```

**Dollar Shave Club:**
```
Dollar Shave Club is the ONLY razor company
that delivers quality razors by subscription for a fraction of the price
for men tired of overpaying
in the US (initially)
when they're fed up with the razor-buying experience
because the personal care industry has lost touch with value.
```

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Too Broad
**Bad:** "We're the only tech company that cares about customers."
**Problem:** Generic, unverifiable, could be anyone

### Mistake 2: Feature-Focused
**Bad:** "We're the only phone with 108MP camera."
**Problem:** Features can be copied; benefits can't

### Mistake 3: Multiple Claims
**Bad:** "We're the only restaurant with great food, great service, and great atmosphere."
**Problem:** Multiple claims dilute differentiation

### Mistake 4: Unverifiable
**Bad:** "We're the only company with the best quality."
**Problem:** "Best" is subjective and undifferentiating

### Mistake 5: Wrong Category
**Bad:** "We're the only restaurant that serves Mexican food."
**Problem:** Category too narrow or obvious

## From Onliness to Trueline

The onliness statement is internal strategy. It translates to:

**Trueline:** The value proposition you communicate internally
**Tagline:** The customer-facing translation

### Translation Process

1. Start with onliness statement (the "only")
2. Extract the core benefit/meaning
3. Craft trueline (internal proposition)
4. Polish into tagline (external message)

### Example Translation

**Onliness:** "Nike is the ONLY athletic brand that helps ordinary people find their inner athlete."

**Trueline:** "We reveal the athlete inside everyone."

**Tagline:** "Just Do It."

## Validation Checklist

Before finalizing an onliness statement, verify:

### Differentiation Tests
- [ ] Can NO competitor make the same claim?
- [ ] Is it actually different (not just better)?
- [ ] Is the differentiation sustainable?

### Meaning Tests
- [ ] Does it matter to target customers?
- [ ] Does it solve a real problem or fulfill a real desire?
- [ ] Is it emotionally resonant, not just functional?

### Clarity Tests
- [ ] Is it brief and memorable?
- [ ] Is it free of "ands" and commas (vampires)?
- [ ] Could a stranger understand it?

### Strategic Tests
- [ ] Does it align with company purpose?
- [ ] Can it guide future decisions?
- [ ] Does it create a clear enemy or alternative?

## Facilitation Questions

Use these to help clients/teams arrive at their onliness:

1. "What would your customers lose if you didn't exist?"
2. "What do you do that no one else does?"
3. "What would a competitor have to copy to become you?"
4. "What's the one thing you'd fight to keep if you had to cut everything else?"
5. "What makes customers choose you when a competitor is cheaper?"
6. "What do you refuse to do that competitors do?"
7. "If your brand were a person, what would make them irreplaceable?"
