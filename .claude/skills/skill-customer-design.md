# Skill: Customer Design

## Purpose

Enable brand agents to design who customers BECOME through engaging with the brand, not just who they are. This skill operationalizes the Brand Flip insight that the best brand builders see greatness in their customers and figure out ways to enable it.

## Standards Awareness

Before applying this skill, ensure familiarity with:
- `standards/signalos/brand-strategy.md`
- `.claude/skills/skill-brand-flip.md`
- `.claude/skills/skill-brand-facilitation.md`

## Core Philosophy

### From Company Identity to Customer Identity

> "Its not enough to find out who your customers are. You need to help them become the people they want to be."

The traditional approach focuses on company identity—making sure we look modern, organized, and professional. The flipped approach focuses on **customer identity**—understanding who they want to become and designing products/services that help them get there.

**The Brand Flip Insight:**
If the goal is to create customers (as Peter Drucker suggested), shouldn't we also be designing them? We should design a framework in which customers can see themselves, build their unique identities, and ultimately become who they are meant to be.

## The Customer Design Framework

### Three Dimensions of Customer Design

| Dimension | Question | Focus |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Identity** | Who do they want to become? | Transformation |
| **Transformation** | How do we help them become that? | Journey |
| **Journey** | What touchpoints enable the transformation? | Experience |

---

## Dimension 1: Customer Identity

### Current State Discovery

**Demographic Questions:**
- Who loves your products or services?
- Which men or women specifically?
- Where are they located?
- What are their goals?

**Psychographic Questions:**
- What tribe are they looking to plug into?
- What activities, interests, and opinions define them?
- What behaviors signal who they are?
- How do they currently see themselves?

### Transformed State Discovery

**The Core Questions:**
- More important than demographics: who do they want to BECOME?
- What does your product symbolize to them?
- How can your brand help build your customers' identities?
- "If I buy this product, what does that say/make of me?"

**Transformation Articulation Questions:**
- What is the highest good you could do for people who engage with your service?
- How will you back it up or enforce that good?
- What wealth will you create for them? (social, educational, physical, spiritual, temporal)

### Identity Transformation Examples

| Brand | Current State | Transformed State |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| Google | Information seekers | A little smarter |
| Apple | Creative thinkers | A little more creative |
| Mini USA | Drivers | Conscientious drivers |
| Ritz-Carlton | Hotel guests | More sophisticated |
| Joie De Vivre | Travelers | Refreshed identities |
| Nike | Athletic individuals | Peak performers |

**Pattern:** The transformation is specific, aspirational, and achievable through the brand experience.

## Dimension 2: Customer Transformation

### The Transformation Promise Framework

```
We help [target customer]
become [transformation]
by providing [mechanism].
```

### Designing the Transformation

**Step 1: Identify the Aspiration**
- What does greatness look like for your customer?
- What transformation would make their life meaningfully better?
- What identity shift would they be proud of?

**Step 2: Design the Mechanism**
- How does your product/service enable that transformation?
- What experiences create identity shifts?
- What proof points demonstrate the transformation?

**Step 3: Validate the Promise**
- Can your product/service actually deliver this transformation?
- Is the transformation specific enough to be measurable?
- Is it aspirational enough to create meaning?

### Transformation Depth Scale

| Level | Type | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Functional** | What they can do | Use technology more efficiently |
| **Symbolic** | What it says about them | Signals success and good taste |
| **Experiential** | How they feel | Confident and empowered |
| **Transformational** | Who they become | A more creative person |

**Goal:** Aim for transformational level when possible. It creates the deepest customer commitment.

## Dimension 3: Customer Journey

### The Identity Building Journey

Each touchpoint should help customers build their identity:

```
Discovery → Consideration → Purchase → Use → Advocacy
    ↓            ↓             ↓        ↓        ↓
"I notice    "This might   "I choose  "I am    "I belong
 myself"      be me"        to become"  becoming" to this"
```

### Journey Touchpoints for Transformation

| Stage | Customer Mindset | Design For |
|-------|------------------|------------|
| **Awareness** | "This seems relevant" | Recognition of aspiration |
| **Interest** | "This could help me" | Vision of transformed self |
| **Evaluation** | "Can this work for me?" | Proof of transformation |
| **Purchase** | "I'm choosing this identity" | Commitment moment |
| **Experience** | "I'm becoming" | Transformation delivery |
| **Advocacy** | "This is who I am" | Identity confirmation |

## The Brand Commitment Scale

### From Satisfaction to Empowerment

| Level | State | Customer Experience | Identity Impact |
|-------|-------|--------------------|--------------------|
| 1 | **Satisfaction** | They're content | Product meets needs |
| 2 | **Delight** | They're impressed | Product exceeds expectations |
| 3 | **Engagement** | They're enrolled | Brand becomes part of identity |
| 4 | **Empowerment** | They're co-leading | Brand is core to who they are |

### Level 4: Customer Empowerment

**Characteristics of Empowered Customers:**
- Incorporate the brand into the deepest parts of their lives
- Depend on it for emotional support, social status, personal growth
- Move heaven and earth to ensure the brand's success
- Attract others to the tribe with magnetic commitment
- Co-create the brand experience

**Design for Empowerment:**
- Give customers meaningful roles in the tribe
- Enable them to express their transformed identity
- Create opportunities for contribution and creation
- Celebrate their transformation publicly

## Brand Commitment Matrix Integration

### The I AM + POV Framework

| Customer (I AM) | Company (POV) | Alignment Question |
|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Identity:** Who I want to become | **Purpose:** Why we exist | Does our purpose help them become who they want to be? |
| **Aims:** What I want | **Onliness:** What we uniquely offer | Does our offering serve their transformation goals? |
| **Mores:** How I/we behave | **Values:** How we behave | Are our behaviors in sync with their tribal identity? |

### Alignment Check Process

1. **Map Customer I AM**
   - Who do they want to become? (Identity)
   - What do they want from us? (Aims)
   - How do they belong to the tribe? (Mores)

2. **Map Company POV**
   - Why do we exist beyond money? (Purpose)
   - What makes us the only? (Onliness)
   - How do we behave? (Values)

3. **Check Horizontal Alignment**
   - Purpose ↔ Identity: We help them become who they want to be
   - Onliness ↔ Aims: Our unique offering serves their goals
   - Values ↔ Mores: Our behaviors sync with their tribal behaviors

**If alignment is broken, the brand is broken.**

4. What are their immediate, stated goals?
5. What tribe are they looking to plug into?
6. How do they currently describe themselves?

### Phase 2: Aspiration (Transformed State)

2. What does your product symbolize to them?
3. "If I buy this product, what does that say/make of me?"
4. How can your brand help build their identities?
5. What is the highest good you could do for them?
6. How will you back it up or enforce that good?

### Phase 3: Commitment (Tribe Membership)

2. What will they contribute to the tribe?
3. What behaviors define membership?
4. What signals belonging vs. exclusion?
5. What investors, partners, and suppliers get from the tribe?

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Common Customer Design Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Better Approach |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| Focus only on demographics | Misses the transformation | Lead with "who they want to become" |
| Generic transformation | No emotional resonance | Be specific: "smarter" not "better" |
| Undeliverable promises | Erodes trust | Only promise what product can deliver |
| Company-centric framing | Ignores customer identity | Start with customer aspiration |
| Skipping alignment check | Creates broken brand | Always verify I AM ↔ POV alignment |

### Las Vegas Anti-Pattern

> "Las Vegas casinos care little about their customers' lives beyond offering a brief respite from the daily tedium. When visitors get back home, they'll face the same old grind but with thinner wallet. This is the opposite of seeing greatness in customers. Instead, they see only weakness, naivete and addictive behaviour."

**All profitable brands are habit-forming at some level. The only question is whether the habit, on balance, is a healthy or unhealthy one.**

## Key Insight

**"The best brand builders see greatness in their customers and figure out ways to enable it."**

When a product becomes a symbol, the symbol becomes a product. It can offer tremendous value as a building block in a customer's personal identity.

The question isn't just "Who are our customers?" but **"Who do we want our customers to become?"**
