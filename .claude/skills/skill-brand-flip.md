# Skill: Brand Flip Framework

## Purpose

Execute the Brand Flip methodology for building customer-centric, tribe-driven brands. This skill operationalizes the shift from company-centric branding to customer-centric brand building using the I AM + POV framework.

## Standards Awareness

Before applying this skill, ensure familiarity with:
- `standards/signalos/tribe-building.md`
- `standards/signalos/brand-strategy.md`

## The Brand Flip Model

### Old Model (Company-Centric)
```
Company creates brand → Brand attracts customers → Customers support company
```

### New Model (Customer-Centric)
```
Company creates customers → Customers create brand → Brand sustains company
```

**Core Truth:** A brand is not owned by the company, but by the customers who draw meaning from it.

---

## The 10 New Realities

These truths must inform all brand strategy:

1. Power has shifted from companies to customers
2. People are not focused on products, but meaning
3. Customers buy products to build their identities
4. They hate being sold, but they love to buy
5. They buy in tribes to feel safe and successful
6. The battle is no longer between companies, but tribes
7. The company with the strongest tribe wins
8. Tribes are connected through technology
9. Brands need to flow through multiple technologies
10. The most successful brands are not static, but fluid

## The Brand Commitment Matrix

The heart of the Brand Flip framework is aligning customer needs with company offerings.

### Template

| Customer (I AM) | Company (POV) | Alignment |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------|
| **Identity:** Who I am / want to become | **Purpose:** Why we exist | Do we help them become who they want to be? |
| **Aims:** What I want from you | **Onliness:** What we uniquely offer | Does our offering serve their goals? |
| **Mores:** How I/we behave | **Values:** How we behave | Are our behaviors in sync? |

### Process

#### Step 1: Define Customer I AM

**Identity (Who they want to become)**
- What transformation do they seek?
- Who do they aspire to be?
- What self-image are they building?

**Key Question:** "If I buy this product, what does that make me?"

**Aims (What they want)**
- What functional benefits do they need?
- What emotional benefits do they seek?
- What social benefits matter?

**Mores (How they belong)**
- What are the rules of their tribe?
- What behaviors are celebrated?
- What behaviors are rejected?
- What signals membership?

#### Step 2: Define Company POV

**Purpose (Why we exist)**
- The fundamental reason beyond making money
- Should never change
- Should align with customer identity

**Onliness (What makes us the only)**
- Unique offering that serves customer aims
- Using the ZAG "only" framework
- Clear competitive differentiation

**Values (How we behave)**
- Operating principles
- Cultural commitments
- Behavioral standards

#### Step 3: Check Alignment

| If This... | Then This... | Result |
|------------|--------------|--------|
| Identity ↔ Purpose | We help them become who they want to be | Strong fit |
| Aims ↔ Onliness | Our unique offering serves their goals | Value exchange works |
| Mores ↔ Values | We behave how they expect | Trust builds |

**If they don't align, you have a broken brand.**

## Customer Transformation Design

### The Core Question

"Who do you want your customers to become?"

### Transformation Examples

| Brand | Transformation |
|-------|----------------|
| Google | Make people smarter |
| Apple | Make people more creative |
| Nike | Make people more athletic |
| Ritz-Carlton | Make people more sophisticated |
| Mini | Make people more conscientious drivers |

### The Transformation Promise Framework

```
We help [target customer] become [transformation]
by providing [mechanism].
```

### Identifying Transformation Opportunities

**Questions to Ask:**
- What is the highest good you can want for your customers?
- How will you back it up or enforce that good?
- What wealth will your product create for them? (social, educational, physical, spiritual, temporal)
- How does your product become a building block in their identity?

---

## From Segments to Tribes

### Segmentation vs. Tribe Building

| Segmentation | Tribe Building |
|--------------|----------------|
| Divide and conquer | Multiply and conquer |
| Top-down targeting | Organic growth |
| Passive audiences | Active communities |
| Demographics | Identity and belonging |

### Tribe Formation Principles

1. **Start small** — Find your truest fans, not the biggest market
2. **Enable group-forming** — Social tools allow ridiculously easy group formation
3. **Support, don't target** — Grow it, partner with it, organize it
4. **Build depth** — Fans respect generosity and bravery

### Questions for Tribe Building

- "You and what army?" (Not "What size is the market?")
- What does sharing this brand say about the customer?
- Do they believe in the values of this company?
- What special jobs can they have in the context of the tribe?

## From Storytelling to Storyframing

### The Shift

| Storytelling | Storyframing |
|--------------|--------------|
| Brand tells stories | Brand provides framework |
| Single narrator | Multiple participants |
| Passive consumption | Active creation |
| Brand is hero | Customer is hero |

### Storyframe Components

1. **The Frame** — POV (Purpose, Onliness, Values) provides boundaries
2. **The Protagonist** — Customer (Identity, Aims, Mores) is the hero
3. **The Touchpoints** — Where customer stories unfold
4. **The Arc** — The transformation journey
5. **The Profluence** — Forward flow, sense the story is going somewhere

### Storyframing Questions

- How will your customers tell their stories?
- Will they be able to create profluence in their own lives?
- What transformation does your product enable?
- How do you help them become the hero?

## The Brand Commitment Scale (BCS)

### Four Levels of Commitment

| Level | State | Description | Measure |
|-------|-------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | Satisfaction | They're content | J.D. Powers surveys |
| 2 | Delight | They're impressed | NPS, CX Index |
| 3 | Engagement | They're enrolled | Participation metrics |
| 4 | Empowerment | They're co-leading | Advocacy, UGC, community roles |

### Goal: Move Customers Up the Ladder

**Level 4 Customer Indicators:**
- Incorporate brand into deepest parts of their lives
- Depend on it for emotional support, social status, personal growth
- Move heaven and earth to ensure brand success
- Attract others with magnetic sense of commitment

---

## Brand Experience Design

### The Four Quadrants

| | Shallow | Deep |
|---|---------|------|
| **General** | Brand awareness (ads, content) | Tribal touchpoints (events, community) |
| **Personal** | Social media engagement | Deep personal engagement (co-creation) |

### Touchpoint Design Principles

1. **Choose the most telling touchpoints** — Quality over quantity
2. **Use as few as possible** — More touchpoints = more complexity and cost
3. **Provide access anytime, anywhere** — But prioritize high-impact moments
4. **Design for identity building** — Every touchpoint should help customers build their identity

### Experience Fractal Principle

Each experience is the brand in miniature. If a particular experience doesn't reflect the overall brand, pull it out — it's a weed in a purposeful garden.
