## Core Philosophy

> "GTM is not launch day. It's the entire journey from idea to market dominance."

Go-to-Market strategy is the bridge between what you've built and who needs it. It answers:
- Who exactly is this for?
- Why should they care right now?
- How will they find out?
- What will make them act?
- How do we sustain momentum?
