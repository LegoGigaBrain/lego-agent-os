# onliness-statement

You are running the **Onliness Statement** workflow in LEGO Agent OS.

Goal:
Create a powerful onliness statement that articulates radical differentiation. The onliness statement is the true test of whether a brand has achieved a ZAG — if you can't say you're the "only," you don't have differentiation worth fighting for.

Primary Agent:
- @brand-strategist

Skills:
- Onliness Statement
- ZAG Positioning (Checkpoint 6)

Standards:

## Steps

### 1. Gather Context

Ask:
- What is the brand/product/service?
- What category do you compete in?
- Who are your competitors?
- What do customers currently say about why they choose you?
- What can you claim that competitors can't?

---

### 2. Competitor Claim Audit

List all competitors who could make the same claims as you.

For each common claim, ask:
- Can competitors say this too?
- Is this truly differentiating?
- Would customers believe we're the "only"?

**Purpose:** Expose where you overlap (no differentiation) vs. where there's white space.

---

### 3. Draft Basic Onliness Statement

**Template:**
```
"[Brand] is the ONLY [category] that [differentiator]."
```

**First blank:** The category you compete in
**Second blank:** Your unique differentiation

**Rules:**
- Must be brief
- Must use the word "only"
- Must be defensible (competitors can't make the same claim)

**Test Questions:**
1. Can ANY competitor truthfully make this claim?
2. Would customers believe we're the "only"?
3. Is this differentiation meaningful to customers?

If yes to question 1, go back and sharpen.

### 4. Expand to Full Framework

Add the who, where, when, why elements:

| Element | Question | Answer |
|---------|----------|--------|
| What | What is your category? | |
| How | How are you different? | |
| Who | Who are your customers? | |
| Where | Where are they located? | |
| When | When do they need you? | |
| Why | Why are you important? | |

**Extended Template:**
```
"[Brand] is the ONLY [category]
that [differentiator]
for [customer segment]
in [geographic/market scope]
during [need state/moment]
because [underlying trend/importance]."
```

---

### 5. Check for Vampires

**Watch out for "ands" and commas** — they drain away difference.

**Bad Examples:**
- "We're the only coffee shop that has great coffee AND friendly service AND convenient locations."
- "We're the only platform that is fast, secure, and easy to use."

**Good Examples:**
- "We're the only coffee shop that roasts beans on-site daily."
- "We're the only platform designed for [specific audience]."

If you find "ands" or commas, you have multiple claims. Pick the strongest one.

---

### 6. Translate to Trueline & Tagline

**Trueline:** Internal value proposition (what you communicate internally)
**Tagline:** External, customer-facing translation

**Translation Process:**
1. Start with onliness statement
2. Extract core benefit/meaning
3. Craft trueline (internal)
4. Polish into tagline (external)

**Example:**
- Onliness: "Nike is the ONLY athletic brand that helps ordinary people find their inner athlete."
- Trueline: "We reveal the athlete inside everyone."
- Tagline: "Just Do It."

## Facilitation Questions

Use these to help arrive at onliness:

1. "What would your customers lose if you didn't exist?"
2. "What do you do that no one else does?"
3. "What would a competitor have to copy to become you?"
4. "What's the one thing you'd fight to keep if you had to cut everything else?"
5. "What makes customers choose you when a competitor is cheaper?"
6. "What do you refuse to do that competitors do?"
7. "If your brand were a person, what would make them irreplaceable?"
