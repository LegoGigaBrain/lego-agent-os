## Steps

### 1. Clarify Engagement Level

Determine the intensity of the engagement:

| Level | Scope | Output |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **Spark** | Quick positioning clarity | Onliness + basic positioning |
| **Core** | Full brand strategy | Complete brand OS |
| **Residency** | Deep integration | Brand OS + implementation guidance |

Ask:
- What level of engagement is needed?
- Is this a new brand or repositioning?
- What exists already? (discovery docs, existing strategy, visual identity)
- Who are the key stakeholders?
- What's the timeline?

---

### 2. SYNC Phase – Discovery

**Goal:** Extract the founder/brand signal

**Questions to Explore:**

*Identity Questions (Who are you?)*
- What's the origin story? How did this start?
- What would you do even if no one paid you?
- What makes you uncomfortable about competitors?
- What would posterity say about you?

*Purpose Questions (What do you do?)*
- Beyond making money, why do you exist?
- What problem are you really solving?
- What would the world lose if you disappeared?

*Vision Questions (Where are you going?)*
- In 10 years, what does success look like?
- What's the concrete picture of your ideal future?

*Trend Questions (What wave are you riding?)*
- What cultural shifts support your existence?
- What's changing that makes you relevant now?

*Differentiation Questions (What makes you the only?)*
- What can you claim that competitors can't?
- Why do your best customers choose you over alternatives?
- What would you never compromise on?

*Tribe Questions (Who loves you?)*
- Who are your truest fans?
- What transformation do they seek?
- What do they get from being associated with you?

**Output: Discovery File**
- Founder narrative
- Origin pulse
- Core tensions
- Differentiators
- Tribe profile

### 3. PROGRAM Phase – Strategy Development

**Goal:** Synthesize discovery into strategy artifacts

#### 3a. Archetype Mapping
Invoke @archetype-analyst to:
- Identify primary archetype
- Identify secondary archetype
- Map shadow archetype
- Define archetypal expression

#### 3b. Positioning Development
Using skill-zag-positioning, work through:
- Focus checkpoints (1-4)
- Differentiation checkpoints (5-8)
- Communications checkpoints (9-15)
- Create onliness statement

#### 3c. Tribe Definition
Using skill-brand-flip, develop:
- Customer I AM (Identity, Aims, Mores)
- Company POV (Purpose, Onliness, Values)
- Alignment verification
- Transformation promise

#### 3d. Language Stack Development
Create:
- Tagline (compressed frequency)
- Tone Matrix (3-5 tonal qualities with examples)
- Lexicon (10-20 branded terms)
- Transmission Lines (recurring phrases)

#### 3e. Visual Direction (Strategic)
Invoke @brand-identity-architect to develop:
- Visual direction brief
- Aesthetic territory
- Symbolic references
- What to avoid
