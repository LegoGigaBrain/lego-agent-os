### 4. Identify Primary + Secondary

**Primary Archetype:** The dominant energy (70% of brand expression)
**Secondary Archetype:** The supporting flavor (30% of brand expression)

**Selection Criteria:**
- Highest alignment with brand behavior
- Strongest resonance with customer relationship
- Most authentic to founder/team energy
- Creates competitive differentiation

**Blend Analysis:**
How do primary and secondary work together?
- Hero + Sage = The Expert Champion
- Magician + Creator = The Visionary Maker
- Outlaw + Lover = The Passionate Rebel

### 5. Map Shadow Archetype

Every archetype has a shadow — the dark side to avoid:

| Archetype | Shadow |
|-----------|--------|
| Innocent | Naïve, in denial, boring |
| Sage | Dogmatic, out of touch, ivory tower |
| Explorer | Aimless, misfit, unable to commit |
| Ruler | Authoritarian, controlling, rigid |
| Creator | Perfectionist, impractical, self-indulgent |
| Caregiver | Martyr, codependent, smothering |
| Hero | Arrogant, ruthless, always needs an enemy |
| Outlaw | Criminal, self-destructive, alienating |
| Magician | Manipulative, disconnected from reality |
| Lover | Obsessive, shallow, people-pleasing |
| Jester | Irresponsible, offensive, unable to be serious |
| Everyman | Losing identity, too plain, forgettable |

**Shadow Warning:** Specific behaviors to avoid based on archetype.
