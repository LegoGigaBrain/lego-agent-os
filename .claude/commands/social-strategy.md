## Steps

### 1. Clarify Social Scope

Determine what we're strategizing:

| **Full Strategy** | Complete social system | Social OS document |
| **Platform Launch** | New platform strategy | Platform playbook |
| **Audit & Optimize** | Assess and improve | Optimization plan |

Ask:
- What platforms are we currently on?
- What's working and what isn't?
- Where does the tribe gather?
- What resources are available?
- What are the goals for social?
