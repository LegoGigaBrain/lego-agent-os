# brand-positioning

You are running the **Brand Positioning** workflow in LEGO Agent OS.

Goal:
Execute the ZAG 17-checkpoint positioning methodology to achieve radical differentiation. This focused workflow produces positioning artifacts without the full brand strategy depth.

Primary Agent:
- @brand-strategist

Skills:
- ZAG Positioning (17 checkpoints)
- Onliness Statement

Standards:
- `standards/signalos/brand-strategy.md`

## Steps

### 1. Clarify Scope

Ask:
- Is this a new brand or repositioning an existing one?
- What category do you compete in?
- Who are your main competitors?
- What positioning exists today (if any)?
- What's driving the need for positioning work?

---

### 2. Focus Checkpoints (1-4)

Work through each checkpoint, gathering information:

#### Checkpoint 1: Who Are You?

**Obituary Exercise:**
"Imagine 25 years from now your company has gone out of business. Write a glowing obituary extolling its contributions to the world. Make it big, bold, and courageous."

After writing, ask:
- Why don't we do this?
- Does it seem crazy because it's so far from where we are now?
- Is there anything physically impossible about these goals?

**Output:** Core identity and passion articulated

---

#### Checkpoint 2: What Do You Do?

**Core Purpose:** The fundamental reason you exist beyond making money.

Criteria:
- 12 words or fewer
- Would never change
- Specific enough to guide decisions

**Output:** Purpose statement

---

#### Checkpoint 3: What Is Your Vision?

**Vision:** A concrete picture of the future (not abstract direction)

Example:
- Purpose: "Advancing man's capabilities to explore the heavens"
- Vision: "A man on the moon by the end of the 1960s"

**Output:** Vision statement that is concrete and pictureable

---

#### Checkpoint 4: What Wave Are You Riding?

**Trends:** Cultural shifts that power your brand

Identify:
- Primary trends (macro shifts)
- Secondary trends (category-specific)
- Micro-trends (niche or emerging)

**Output:** 3-5 trends that power the brand

---

### 3. Differentiation Checkpoints (5-8)

#### Checkpoint 5: Who Shares the Brandscape?

Map the competitive landscape:
- Direct competitors
- Indirect competitors
- Market position hierarchy
- White space opportunities

**Output:** Competitive map

---

#### Checkpoint 6: What Makes You the Only?

**Onliness Statement:**
```
"Our brand is the ONLY [category] that [differentiator]."
```

Rules:
- Must use the word "only"
- Must be brief
- Must be defensible (competitors can't claim)

**Extended Framework:**
- What is your category?
- How are you different?
- Who are your customers?
- Where are they located?
- When do they need you?
- Why are you important?

**Output:** Onliness statement

---

#### Checkpoint 7: What Should You Add or Subtract?

**Alignment Analysis:**
- What elements increase focus? (Add)
- What elements decrease focus? (Subtract)

Rule: If adding an element brings competition with a stronger competitor, think twice.

**Output:** Add/subtract list for sharper focus

---

#### Checkpoint 8: Who Loves You?

**Community Mapping:**
- Customers
- Employees
- Partners/suppliers
- Investors
- Non-customers
- Competitors

For each: What value do they get? What value do they give?

**Output:** Stakeholder map with value exchange

---

### 4. Communications Checkpoints (9-15)

#### Checkpoint 9: Who's Your Enemy?

Define what you stand against:
- Competitor
- Old way of thinking
- Status quo

Goal: Use contrast to throw differentiation into sharp relief

**Output:** Enemy statement

---

#### Checkpoint 10: What Do They Call You?

**Name Evaluation:**
- Different from competitors
- Brief (4 syllables or less)
- Appropriate but not generic
- Easy to spell
- Satisfying to pronounce
- Suitable for "brandplay"
- Legally defensible

**Output:** Name assessment (or naming direction)

---

#### Checkpoint 11: How Do You Explain Yourself?

**Trueline:** Value proposition (internal)
**Tagline:** Customer-facing translation

Rule: One proposition per brand. Avoid commas and "ands."

**Output:** Trueline and tagline

---

#### Checkpoint 12-15: Touchpoints & Experience

Quick assessment of:
- Key touchpoints (where customers contact brand)
- Value proposition delivery (how you engage)
- Customer experience (what they experience)
- Loyalty mechanisms (how you earn loyalty)

**Output:** Touchpoint and experience overview
