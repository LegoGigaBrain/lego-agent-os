## Steps

### 1. Define Naming Scope

Determine what we're naming:

| Type | Description | Considerations |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Brand** | Company or primary brand | Trademark critical, domain essential |
| **Product** | Specific offering | May need system, portfolio fit |
| **Feature** | Product capability | Clarity, brand alignment |
| **Category** | Creating/claiming space | Thought leadership, adoption |
| **Campaign** | Marketing initiative | Temporary, memorable |

Ask:
- What are we naming?
- What's the parent brand (if any)?
- What's the naming architecture?
- What constraints exist (legal, domain, global)?
- What names already exist in the portfolio?
