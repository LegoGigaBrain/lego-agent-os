## Steps

### 1. Define Campaign Context

Establish the foundation:

| Campaign Type | Purpose | Typical Duration |
|---------------|---------|------------------|
| **Launch** | Introduce something new | 2-8 weeks |
| **Awareness** | Expand reach/recognition | Ongoing or quarterly |
| **Conversion** | Drive specific action | 1-4 weeks |
| **Retention** | Deepen relationships | Lifecycle-based |
| **Cultural Moment** | Leverage events/trends | Hours to days |

Ask:
- What's the business objective?
- What's the marketing objective?
- Who is the target audience?
- What's the timeline?
- What budget is available?
- What channels are we using?
