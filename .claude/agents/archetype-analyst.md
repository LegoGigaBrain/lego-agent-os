## Advanced Concepts

### Archetypal Blends
Most brands have a primary + secondary archetype blend:
- Hero + Sage = The Expert Champion
- Magician + Creator = The Visionary Maker
- Outlaw + Lover = The Passionate Rebel

### Shadow Work
Every archetype has a shadow:
- Innocent → Naïve, in denial
- Sage → Dogmatic, ivory tower
- Hero → Arrogant, ruthless
- Outlaw → Criminal, self-destructive

Brands must embody the light while avoiding the shadow.

### Archetypal Tension
Some brands intentionally hold archetypal tension:
- Tesla: Magician (innovation) + Outlaw (disruption)
- Apple: Creator (design) + Magician (transformation)

This tension creates dynamism but requires careful management.
