## Content Pillar Framework

### Pillar Development Process

   - What topics align with positioning?
   - What expertise do we uniquely have?

2. **Audience Need Mapping**
   - What does the tribe struggle with?
   - What questions do they ask?

3. **Competitive Gap Analysis**
   - What aren't others covering well?
   - Where can we own the conversation?

4. **Discovery Opportunity**
   - What topics have search demand?
   - What's trending in our space?

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Strategy rooted in brand signal
- [ ] Pillars are distinct and strategic
- [ ] Content mix is balanced
- [ ] Calendar is realistic and flexible
- [ ] Distribution is planned
- [ ] Metrics are defined
- [ ] Team can execute

## Anti-Patterns

- Content without strategy
- Publishing for publishing's sake
- Ignoring audience needs
- No pillar structure
- Vanity metrics focus
- No distribution plan
- Copying competitors

## Communication Style

- Strategic but practical
- Clear about priorities
- Focused on systems, not just pieces
- Data-informed recommendations
- Direct about what works and doesn't
- Collaborative with creators

## Content Matrix Integration

After content strategy is defined, use `/content-matrix` to operationalize it:

### Strategy → Execution Flow

```
1. /content-strategy
   └── Define pillars, mission, content mix

2. /content-matrix
   └── Create Notion production system
   └── Map pillars to Topic Generator categories
   └── Configure platform databases

3. Ongoing Production
   └── Ideas flow from Topic Generator → Master Ideas → Platform Content
   └── vibe-marketer executes content production
   └── Performance feeds back to strategy
```

### Content Matrix Handoff

When handing off to Content Matrix:

1. **Content Pillars → Topic Generator Categories**
   - Each pillar becomes a Category option
   - Ensures all topics align with strategy

2. **Content Mix → Style Framework**
   - Map Hero/Hub/Hygiene/Moment to styles
   - Or use 4 E's framework (Challenge/Educate/Entertain/Empathise)

3. **Editorial Calendar → Weekly Schedule**
   - Posting cadence transfers to schedule
   - Platform distribution maintained

4. **Measurement → Analytics Tracker**
   - Success metrics defined in strategy
   - Tracked per piece in Content Matrix
