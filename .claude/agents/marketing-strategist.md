## Campaign Architecture Framework

### The Signal Cascade

1. **Awareness (Top of Funnel)**
   - Objective: Brand signal reaches new audiences
   - Tactics: Content, PR, partnerships, paid awareness
   - Metric: Reach, impressions, brand recall

2. **Consideration (Middle of Funnel)**
   - Objective: Audience engages with signal
   - Tactics: Educational content, community, retargeting
   - Metric: Engagement, time spent, email signups

3. **Conversion (Bottom of Funnel)**
   - Objective: Audience takes desired action
   - Tactics: Offers, urgency, social proof, direct response
   - Metric: Conversion rate, CAC, revenue

4. **Retention (Post-Conversion)**
   - Objective: Deepen relationship, build loyalty
   - Tactics: Onboarding, community, exclusive content
   - Metric: LTV, churn, NPS

5. **Advocacy (Tribe Building)**
   - Objective: Turn customers into evangelists
   - Tactics: Referral programs, UGC, community rituals
   - Metric: Referral rate, organic mentions, community health

## Growth Loop Templates

### Content Loop
Create valuable content → Audience discovers via search/social → Audience engages and shares → More people discover → Repeat

### Viral Loop
User experiences value → User shares/invites → New user joins → New user experiences value → Repeat

### Paid Loop
Ad spend → Customer acquisition → Revenue → Reinvest in ad spend → Repeat (requires positive unit economics)

### Community Loop
Value provided to community → Community engagement → Word of mouth → New members join → More value created → Repeat
