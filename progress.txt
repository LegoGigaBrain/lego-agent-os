# Progress Log

## Learnings
(Patterns discovered during implementation)
- Skill files follow pattern: Purpose, Standards Awareness, Core Content, Output Format, Handoffs, Related Skills
- Research notes in `docs/research/` contain valuable questions to incorporate into skills
- Brand skills reference existing skills like skill-brand-flip.md and skill-onliness-statement.md

---

## Iteration 1 - US-001: Create Brand Facilitation Skill
- Created `.claude/skills/skill-brand-facilitation.md`
- Included 6 discovery phases: Origin & Context, Positioning, Purpose (VPVMG), Customer Design, Onliness Statement, Brand Commitment Matrix
- Questions derived from `docs/research/Brand Faciliation Notes.docx.md`
- Output format: brand-discovery-brief.md
- Handoffs: @brand-strategist, @verbal-identity-designer, @visual-designer, @research-analyst, @user-researcher, @ideation-facilitator
- Files changed: `.claude/skills/skill-brand-facilitation.md` (new)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Follow existing skill patterns (see skill-brand-flip.md for reference)
  - Include Philosophy/Core Principle section at the start
  - Session Best Practices and Quality Checklist are useful additions
  - Handoff decision trees provide clarity for routing
---

## Iteration 2 - US-002: Create Brand Facilitator Agent
- Created `.claude/agents/brand-facilitator.md`
- Included frontmatter: name (brand-facilitator), department (strategy), description, tools (Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, AskUserQuestion)
- Referenced PRIMARY skill: skill-brand-facilitation.md
- Defined mission as interview/document NOT execute with "Critical Distinction" and "What You Do NOT Do" sections
- Included workflow: Opening, Phase-by-Phase Discovery, Synthesis, Handoff
- Included quality checklist (9 items) and collaboration section with primary/support handoffs
- Files changed: `.claude/agents/brand-facilitator.md` (new), `PRD.md` (updated)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Agent files follow pattern: frontmatter, Standards Awareness, Skills, Identity, Mission, Responsibilities, Workflow, Output Format, Quality Checklist, Communication Style, Collaboration
  - Facilitator agents need explicit "What You Do NOT Do" section to clarify boundaries
  - Include "Receives From" in collaboration to show inbound handoffs
  - Commands section at the end lists associated slash commands
---

## Iteration 3 - US-003: Create Brand Discovery Command
- Created `.claude/commands/brand-discovery.md`
- Command structure follows pattern: Goal, Primary Agent, Supporting Agents, Skills, Standards, Overview, Steps/Phases, Output Location, Success Criteria, Handoff Recommendations, Notes, Agents Involved, Getting Started
- Included "When to Use This Command" table with comparison to other commands
- Listed all 6 discovery phases from the brand-facilitation skill
- Success criteria checklist with 9 items
- Handoff table maps discovery results to specific commands/agents
- "Important Notes" section clarifies what brand discovery IS vs IS NOT
- Files changed: `.claude/commands/brand-discovery.md` (new), `PRD.md` (updated)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Command files for facilitator workflows should clearly distinguish from executor workflows
  - "When to Use" comparison tables help users route to correct command
  - Mirroring the phases from the skill in the command helps users understand the process
  - Include "What This Is NOT" section to prevent misuse
---

## Iteration 4 - US-004: Create Product Ideation Skill
- Created `.claude/skills/skill-product-ideation.md`
- Included 5 discovery phases: Problem Space, Solution Exploration, Market Fit, Feasibility, Vision
- Each phase has 7-8 questions focused on founder discovery
- Output format: product-ideation-brief.md with structured sections
- Handoff decision tree covers: @brand-facilitator, @user-researcher, @research-analyst, @senior-architect, @business-strategist, @product-manager
- Added "Red Flags to Surface" section to help facilitators identify common concerns
- Files changed: `.claude/skills/skill-product-ideation.md` (new), `PRD.md` (updated)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Product ideation is explicitly positioned as BEFORE brand (problem-first thinking)
  - Include "Red Flags" section for facilitator skills to guide honest assessment
  - Recommended Path in output format helps route to appropriate next steps
  - Quality checklist mirrors the phases to ensure complete coverage
---

## Iteration 5 - US-005: Create Ideation Facilitator Agent
- Created `.claude/agents/ideation-facilitator.md`
- Included frontmatter: name (ideation-facilitator), department (strategy), description, tools (Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, AskUserQuestion)
- Referenced PRIMARY skill: skill-product-ideation.md
- Defined mission as product discovery BEFORE brand with "Critical Distinction" and "What You Do NOT Do" sections
- Included workflow: Opening, Phase-by-Phase Discovery, Synthesis, Handoff
- Included quality checklist (10 items) matching skill phases
- Collaboration section includes bidirectional handoffs with @brand-facilitator
- Files changed: `.claude/agents/ideation-facilitator.md` (new), `PRD.md` (updated)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Facilitator agents should mirror their skill's phases in the workflow section
  - Include "Receives From" section showing when this agent is invoked by others (not just direct invocation)
  - Belief System should reflect the agent's core philosophy (problem-first for ideation, founder-articulation for brand)
  - "What You Do NOT Do" section is critical for facilitators to prevent scope creep
---

## Iteration 6 - US-006: Create Product Discovery Command
- Created `.claude/commands/product-discovery.md`
- Followed brand-discovery.md pattern: Goal, Primary Agent, Supporting Agents, Skills, Standards, Overview, When to Use, What This Produces, 5 Discovery Phases, Output Location, Success Criteria, Handoff Recommendations, Important Notes, Agents Involved, Getting Started
- Key content includes:
  - Primary agent: @ideation-facilitator
  - Output location: product/product-ideation-brief.md
  - 10-item success criteria checklist matching skill phases
  - 7 handoff options based on discovery results
  - "When to Use" comparison table for routing
  - "What This Is NOT" section for clarity
- Files changed: `.claude/commands/product-discovery.md` (new), `PRD.md` (updated)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Command files for discovery sessions should parallel the agent's workflow sections
  - Supporting agents list should match the handoff options in the recommendations table
  - "When to Use" tables help users choose the right entry point
  - Success criteria should directly map to what the skill captures in each phase
