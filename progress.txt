# Progress Log

## Learnings
(Patterns discovered during implementation)
- Skill files follow pattern: Purpose, Standards Awareness, Core Content, Output Format, Handoffs, Related Skills
- Research notes in `docs/research/` contain valuable questions to incorporate into skills
- Brand skills reference existing skills like skill-brand-flip.md and skill-onliness-statement.md

---

## Iteration 1 - US-001: Create Brand Facilitation Skill

- Handoff decision tree covers: @brand-facilitator, @user-researcher, @research-analyst, @senior-architect, @business-strategist, @product-manager
- Added "Red Flags to Surface" section to help facilitators identify common concerns
- Files changed: `.claude/skills/skill-product-ideation.md` (new), `PRD.md` (updated)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Product ideation is explicitly positioned as BEFORE brand (problem-first thinking)
  - Include "Red Flags" section for facilitator skills to guide honest assessment
  - Recommended Path in output format helps route to appropriate next steps
  - Quality checklist mirrors the phases to ensure complete coverage
---

## Iteration 5 - US-005: Create Ideation Facilitator Agent

- Included frontmatter: name (ideation-facilitator), department (strategy), description, tools (Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, AskUserQuestion)
- Referenced PRIMARY skill: skill-product-ideation.md
- Defined mission as product discovery BEFORE brand with "Critical Distinction" and "What You Do NOT Do" sections
- Included workflow: Opening, Phase-by-Phase Discovery, Synthesis, Handoff
- Included quality checklist (10 items) matching skill phases
- Collaboration section includes bidirectional handoffs with @brand-facilitator
- Files changed: `.claude/agents/ideation-facilitator.md` (new), `PRD.md` (updated)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Facilitator agents should mirror their skill's phases in the workflow section
  - Include "Receives From" section showing when this agent is invoked by others (not just direct invocation)
  - Belief System should reflect the agent's core philosophy (problem-first for ideation, founder-articulation for brand)
  - "What You Do NOT Do" section is critical for facilitators to prevent scope creep
---

## Iteration 6 - US-006: Create Product Discovery Command
- Created `.claude/commands/product-discovery.md`
- Followed brand-discovery.md pattern: Goal, Primary Agent, Supporting Agents, Skills, Standards, Overview, When to Use, What This Produces, 5 Discovery Phases, Output Location, Success Criteria, Handoff Recommendations, Important Notes, Agents Involved, Getting Started

  - Customer design is distinct from customer research - it's about designing transformation, not just understanding
  - The Brand Flip research notes contain excellent case studies (Google, Apple, Ritz-Carlton, etc.)
  - Anti-Patterns section helps agents avoid common mistakes (Las Vegas anti-pattern)
  - Transformation Depth Scale (Functional → Symbolic → Experiential → Transformational) guides aspiration level

## Iteration 8 - US-008: Update Agent Registry with Facilitators
- Updated `.claude/agent-registry.json` with brand-facilitator and ideation-facilitator agents
- Added to agents section:
  - brand-facilitator: department strategy, capabilities (brand-discovery, founder-interviews, etc.), skills (skill-brand-facilitation, skill-customer-design), escalates_to (brand-strategist, verbal-identity-designer, visual-designer)
  - ideation-facilitator: department strategy, capabilities (product-discovery, product-ideation, etc.), skills (skill-product-ideation), escalates_to (brand-facilitator, user-researcher, research-analyst, etc.)
- Added to task_routing section:
  - "discovery": primary [brand-facilitator, ideation-facilitator], supporting [user-researcher, research-analyst]
  - "facilitation": primary [brand-facilitator, ideation-facilitator], supporting [user-researcher]
- Added to keyword_to_category:
  - discovery, facilitation, facilitator, brand-discovery, product-discovery, ideation, founder-interview

- Files changed: `.claude/agent-registry.json` (updated), `PRD.md` (updated)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Agent registry entries need: department, capabilities, skills, commands, escalates_to (or escalation_target), when_to_use
  - Task routing sections have primary, supporting, and review arrays
  - New categories need corresponding keywords in keyword_to_category for proper routing
  - Always validate JSON after edits with node -e "JSON.parse(...)"
