# Progress Log

## Learnings
(Patterns discovered during implementation)
- Skill files follow pattern: Purpose, Standards Awareness, Core Content, Output Format, Handoffs, Related Skills
- Research notes in `docs/research/` contain valuable questions to incorporate into skills
- Brand skills reference existing skills like skill-brand-flip.md and skill-onliness-statement.md

---

## Iteration 1 - US-001: Create Brand Facilitation Skill
- Created `.claude/skills/skill-brand-facilitation.md`

  - 10-item success criteria checklist matching skill phases
  - 7 handoff options based on discovery results
  - "When to Use" comparison table for routing
  - "What This Is NOT" section for clarity
- Files changed: `.claude/commands/product-discovery.md` (new), `PRD.md` (updated)
